<h1>Psion Organiser Series 1:<br>THE ORGANISER UTILITY PACK</h1>

<hr>

<img align=right src="pics/p1manutil/util_pck.jpg" width="247" height="432" alt="util pack leaflet cover">

<p><strong>IMPORTANT &mdash; Whenever the battery is disconnected, fit the Utility pack before switching
the Organiser on again for the first time. You may then switch off the Organiser and remove
the Utility Pack until you need the Science and Maths functions od the Copy facility.</strong></p>

<h2>SCIENCE and MATHS FUNCTIONS</h2>

<p>When the Utility pack is attached to the Organiser through
one of the solid-state drives, a comprehensive range of mathematical functions
automatically becomes available in CALC'. Any of these functions may be used in
everyday calculations simply by typing its name with a numerical argument or arguments
(i.e. the number or numbers on which it is to operate). They are listed below under the
abbreviated names, which the Organiser recognises. The number of arguments, or parameters,
each one requires is shown below in parentheses.</p>

<p><strong>Note that all angles are measured in radians,
except for the purposes of the angle conversion functions 'DEG' and
'RAD'.</strong></p>

<table summary="Functions">
<tr><td>LOG</td><td>(1)</td><td>Log to the base ten of the given number. Input must be greater than zero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ALOG</td><td>(1)</td><td>Antilog. The result of raising ten to the given power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>LN</td><td>(1)</td><td>Log to the base e, where e = 2.7183 corrected to four decimal places. Input must be greater than zero.
<tr><td>EXP</td><td>(1)</td><td>Exponential value. Raises e to the given power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SORT</td><td>(1)</td><td>Square root. No negative values accepted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SIN</td><td>(1)</td><td>Sine of an angle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>COS</td><td>(1)</td><td>Cosine of an angle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TAN</td><td>(1)</td><td>Tangent of an angle. Organiser registers an error if the angle
yields an infinite tangent, e.g. PI/2 radians (90 degrees), 3PI/2 rads, 5PI/2 rads, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ATN</td><td>(1)</td><td>Arctangent. The angle whose tangent is given.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ABS</td><td>(1)</td><td>Absolute value. Converts a negative number to a positive one. e.g. ABS(-5)=5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>INT</td><td>(1)</td><td>Integer value. Rounds down to whole number. e.g. INT(1.8451)=1</td></tr>
<tr><td>DEG</td><td>(1)</td><td>Converts radians to degrees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>RAD</td><td>(1)</td><td>Converts degrees to radians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MOD</td><td>(2)</td><td>Modulo. Calculates the remainder after dividing the first parameter
by the second. e.g. MOD(20,8) is translated into 20-8*INT(20/8) which works out as 4, 50 that
MOD(20,8)=4. The second parameter must not be equal to zero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MIN</td><td>(1&nbsp;to&nbsp;42)</td><td>Minimum. Finds the smallest of the values given.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MAX</td><td>(1&nbsp;to&nbsp;42)</td><td>Maximum. Finds the greatest of the values given.</td></tr>
<tr><td>FAC</td><td>(1)</td><td>Factorial e.g. FAC(5) is 5*4*3*2*1, so that FAC(5)=120. Input must lie between zero and 69.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SGN</td><td>(1)</td><td>Sign. Looks at the sign of the given number. Its
result is +1 if the number is positive, -1 if it is negative, and zero if it is zero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ROUND</td><td>(1)</td><td>Rounds input to nearest integer. (0.5 is rounded up)</td></tr>
<tr><td>MEAN</td><td>(1&nbsp;to&nbsp;42)</td><td>Calculates the mean of the input values.</td></tr>
<tr><td>STDEV</td><td>(1&nbsp;to&nbsp;42)</td><td>Standard Deviation (n-1 basis) of the input values.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PI</td><td></td><td>Needs no parameters. Produces the value
of the constant pi, which is 3.1416 (corrected), to be used in calculation like any other number.</td></tr>
<tr><td>**</td><td>(0)</td><td>Simply type two multiplication signs together to call
this operation. Raises the number to its left to the power given by the number to its right. e.g. 3**2 = 9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>RND</td><td>(2)</td><td>Random number generator. Returns a
random number in the range bounded by the two inputs, inclusive of the greater but
excluding the lesser. For instance, RND(5,20) may produce any number from 6 to 20
inclusive. These random numbers are random in terms of distribution, but actually depend
on a mathematical formula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>RAND</td><td>(1)</td><td>Randomise. Sets the starting value for the formula which
generates random numbers. This determines the series of random numbers that will result
from subsequent uses of RND. For example, an input RAND(2) always results in the same
series of random numbers, which is different from that resulting from say RAND(4). RAN
D(0) results in an arbitrary starting value for the random number generator, and will give
a different series every time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ENG</td><td>(1)</td><td>Engineering Format. Sets format of output to a number between
1 and 999 times 10 to a power which is a multiple of three. For example, 0.56 is expressed
as 560 E-3, and 56780000 as 56.78 E6. To set this format on, type in ENG(i) and press
<b>EXECUTE</b>. To set it off, type ENG(0) and press <b>EXECUTE</b>. The current setting is active even
when running procedures unless your procedure contains a statement to over-ride it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>FIX</td><td>(1)</td><td>Sets the number of places after
the decimal point for any subsequent output. A negative input with FIX clears the last
setting leaving the number of decimal places open.&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>NOTE &mdash; Both ENG and FIX return their previous status as a result.</p>


<h3>Using Functions</h3>

<p>First select 'CALC'. Now type the name of the function you want to use, followed by the
correct number of parameter values enclosed in brackets. Press <b>EXECUTE</b> to calculate
the result.</p>

<p>A parameter value can be a number or the name of a function or procedure which results
in a number. When you need to enter two or more parameters you should separate each one
from the next by a comma, e.g.</p>

<p align=center><b>MIN(7,9,4,PI,2,1 0)</b></p>

<p>Functions can be linked by arithmetical operators, just as numbers in a basic
arithmetical calculation. Calculations such as:</p>

<p align=center><b>COS(PI/3)*(SIN(2*PI)+LN(2))-1.512*COS(10)</b></p>

<p>are well within Organiser's capabilities.</p>

<p>An outstanding feature of the Utility pack is that it allows you to do calculations
which use the result of one function or procedure as a parameter value for another, so
that calculations may consist of functions stacked within each other like a set of Chinese
boxes. For instance:</p>

<h2>COPY &mdash; to copy datapak contents</h2>

<p>'COPY' is a utility which allows you to copy the
entire contents (All), or the records (Records), or the procedures (Procedures) of one
datapak to another. COPY' always copies from the datapak in drive 1 (the one nearest
the display window) to the datapak in drive 2. When <b>EXECUTE</b> is pressed in this activity,
the Organiser instructs you to insert the datapaks. Remove the Utility pack and place the
datapak from which you wish to copy in drive 1 and an empty or newly formatted datapak in
drive 2. (You don't need to switch off first, but if you do 'Copy' will
still be available when you switch on again.) Next, press <b>EXECUTE</b>: the 'COPY'
utility will ask you whether you wish to copy the entire contents (All), o records of
information (Records) or procedures (Procedures) only. Press A, R, or P. The Organiser
will now copy from the datapak in drive 1 to the datapak in drive 2 according to your
instructions, and leaving out all erased records or procedures.</p>

<h2>WARRANTY</h2>

<p>The warranty for your Utility pack is the same as for your
Organiser, Datapaks and Program packs. See chapter 18 in your Organiser manual.</p>
