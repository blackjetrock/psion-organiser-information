<h2>
THE WESSEX
SOFTWARE
</h2>

<h3>How to use it</h3>

<p>
Costing with the Wessex Materials Computer is straight-
forward. First you choose the trade for which you want
to order materials or cost from the lists of trades in the
computer.
</p>

<p>
Next you enter the dimensions of the work. You can
choose whether to enter the individual dimensions or
series of dimensions separately, or enter the total area
or volume.
</p>

<p>
The computer then calculates the quantities
required, <b>including waste allowance</b>, and can prompt
you to enter the price for each. It will then work out the
cost and, if you want, save the details of the job on the
datapak, so that you can recall it later.
</p>

<h3>Choosing your trade</h3>

<p>
The Materials Computer contains lists of the trades it
can cost. Although the choices in each list are different,
the method of selection is always the same.
</p>

<p>
As the computer screen can only display one line at
a time, you must move up and down the list by using
the &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; keys. These two keys are at the top
right of the keyboard.
</p>

<p>
When you see the option you want, you must press the
<b>EXECUTE</b> key, at the bottom right of the keyboard.
</p>

<p>
When you have made your choice from the list of trades,
you will be asked to make a second choice. If you have
chosen Brick and Blockwork for example, you will then
have to choose what type of brick or blockwork is
required.
</p>

<p>
If you are in the list of trades, pressing the <b>MODE</b> key
takes you out of the Wessex programs.
</p>

<h3>How to use this pamphlet</h3>

<p>
When you have started the Wessex programs and
named the job you are costing, you are in the list
described under the heading <b>TRADES</b>. Look at this
section for guidance when you first start the system.
</p>

<p>
If you choose concrete work, you can turn to the part
of this pamphlet headed <b>Concrete Work</b> for more
information on the types of concrete work allowed for.
If you have chosen glazing, turn to the section headed
<b>Glazing</b>, and so on. All the trades are described.
</p>

<p>
The section headed <b>Quantities and Cost</b> tells you how
to get the final result. If you want to save the result on
the datapak, the section entitled <b>Saving and Finding</b>
will tell you about this.
</p>

<h3>A Drainage Example</h3>

<p>
For example, suppose you want to find the quantities
of materials needed for drainage work. You would first
have to select <b>Drainage</b> from the opening list. Then you
would have to select the type of drainage work you want.
You would have to say whether you were costing
pipework alone, or whether you wanted to cost a sand,
concrete or granular bed for instance.
</p>

<p>
Then the computer will ask for the dimensions of the
job. The questions the computer asks depend upon the
type of job being done. For instance, if you are doing
pipework, the computer will want to know the length
of each pipe, then the length of the pipe runs, If you
are laying a sand bed, the computer will want to know
the length. width and thickness of the bed.
</p>

<p>
When you have entered the dimensions, the computer
will show the quantities needed one by one. For
pipework, it will first show the total length of the pipe
runs needed. Press <b>EXECUTE</b> and the number of
pipes needed is shown. If you press the &gt;&gt; key at this
point, the computer will ask for the price per pipe. It
then works out the cost for that material. When you press
<b>EXECUTE</b> again, the number of joints needed is
shown, and you can then price the joints in the same
way.
</p>

<p>
To work out the cost of a quantity. press &gt;&gt; when you
see it displayed, then enter a price.
</p>

<h3>Saving the details</h3>

<p>
When the quantities and costs have been worked out,
all the details of the job for that trade will be shown on
the screen. If you want to save the job on the datapak,
press <b>EXECUTE</b>. If you do not want to save the job,
press <b>ON/CLEAR</b>.
</p>

<h3>Time Out</h3>

<p>
During normal use, the Psion Organiser will turn itself
off if it is left unattended for five minutes. However, the
computer has been specially programmed never to turn
itself off while you are using the Wessex programs.
</p>

<h3>Error messages</h3>

<p>
Occasionally. you may get an error message. such as
&quot;NO DATAPAK&quot;, which occurs when you try to save
something without having a datapak in place. If you get
an error message, press <b>ON/CLEAR</b> and start the job
again.

</p>

<h3>The List</h3>

<p>
When you have named your job, you are placed at the
top of the list below. Use the &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; keys (at the
top right of the keyboard) to move up and down this
list of trades.
</p>

on that trade.
</p>

<p>
If you want to start a new job with a new name, press
&gt;&gt; until the word <b>Job Id</b> appears on the screen. Press
<b>EXECUTE</b> and the computer will ask you to type in
the new name.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<hr>

<h2>
QUANTITIES
AND COST
</h2>

<p>
When you have chosen the type of work you want, the
Materials Computer will prompt you for the dimensions
of the job to be done.
</p>

<p>
You can usually choose how you describe the size. For
two dimensional items you can either input the length
and width, or you can enter the total area. For three
dimensional items you can enter length, width and
depth, or the total volume.
</p>

<p>
For glazing, for instance, you are given three choices:
DIMENSIONS (i.e. length and width separately), AREA
and END.
</p>

<p>
If you press <b>EXECUTE</b> when <b>DIMENSIONS</b> is on the
screen, the computer then expects you to enter length
and width separately. If you press <b>EXECUTE</b> when
<b>AREA</b> is on the screen, the computer then expects you
to enter the total area of the job.
</p>

<p>
Use <b>MODE</b> or END to finish entering dimensions. You
can enter the dimensions of as many areas as you like.
The computer stores all the dimensions, and adds up
the quantities needed. For example, you might want to
estimate for glazing ten windows. You would enter the
dimensions of each window one by one. The computer
would then work out an estimate of the total quantities
needed for all the windows.
</p>

<h3>Openings</h3>

<p>
The dimensions of any openings in the construction can
be entered in exactly the same way. The area of the
openings is deducted from the main area by the
computer.
</p>

<p>
If there are no openings, press <b>MODE</b>, which acts in
the same way as <b>END</b>.
</p>

<h3>Units</h3>

<p>
Always enter dimensions in SI units, unless stated
otherwise.
</p>

<h3>Cost</h3>

<p>
When you have finished with the dimensions, the
computer will show the total dimensions of the job, and
the quantities of materials needed.
</p>

<p>
If you press the &gt;&gt; key while a quantity is being
displayed, the computer will prompt you for the price
per unit. When you give it the price, the computer will
work out the cost for that material.
</p>

<p>
Press <b>EXECUTE</b> to move on to the next material. All
the materials you need will be displayed one by one,
and may be priced one by one.
</p>

<p>
<b>If you do not price a quantity, its cost will not be added
to the total cost.</b>
</p>

<h3>Total cost</h3>

<p>
The Materials Computer adds the cost for each item
of work to a running total. Every time a cost is worked
out, it is added to this total.
</p>

<p>
When you have finished costing an item of work, you
should be returned to the first list of trades. You can
check the total cost by finding the item <b>Total cost</b> on
this first list, and pressing <b>EXECUTE</b>. The job name
and the total cost should be displayed.
</p>

<p>
If you then press <b>EXECUTE</b> again, the message seen
on the screen will be saved on the datapak. <b>ON/CLEAR</b>
returns you to the main list without saving the total cost
on the datapak.
</p>

<p>
The costs of each item of work continues to be added
to the total until you rename the job or turn off the
computer.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
SAVING
AND FINDING
</h2>

<p>
Once you have worked out the quantities of materials
needed, the Materials Computer can save them on its
datapak. The lists of quantities will each be saved with
a short, six letter name to identify them.
</p>

<p>
When you give a job a name, you may make it up to
150 characters long. All the letters and numbers entered
are stored on the datapak. The first six characters of
the name become the job id.
</p>

<p>
If, for instance, the name you type in is: <b>SMITH, MRS
P., 39, APPLEBY DRIVE, TEL 293450</b> Mrs Smith's
name, address and telephone number will be recorded,
together with the date and time.
</p>

<p>
If you then estimate quantities for a brickwork job for
Mrs Smith, the quantities required, together with the job
identification <b>SMITH</b>, will appear on the screen when
all the calculation has been done.
</p>

<p>
You might, for example, end up with <b>Job SMITH,;Brick
&amp; Blkwork;Brk Stretch bond;0.5 B Tk;2OO m2
area;12088 Brk; 6 m3 mortar</b>.
</p>

<p>
If you press <b>EXECUTE</b> when this appears on the
screen, it will all be saved on the datapak. If you press
<b>ON/CLEAR</b> it will not be saved, and you will be returned
to the first list in the Wessex programs.
</p>

<p>
You may save more than one estimate under the same
Job name. The total cost is saved in exactly the same
way as the estimates for particular jobs.
</p>

<p>
The ability to save estimates is an important feature of
the Materials Computer. It means that you can estimate
quantities and costs on site, then recall them later in the
office, all without using pen or paper.
</p>

<h3>Finding</h3>

<p>
You find a job on the datapak with the <b>FIND</b> key. You
do this from the normal operating system of the
Organiser, not from the Wessex programs. Press the
<b>FIND</b> button, and type in the first six letters of the job
name. Press <b>EXECUTE</b> and the rest of the whole name
should appear (If the name is too long to fit on the
screen, press the &gt;&gt; key to make it scroll.)
</p>

<p>
If you press the <b>EXECUTE</b> key again, the estimate
appears on the screen. If you have made more than
one estimate under the same job name, keep pressing
<b>EXECUTE</b>, and each estimate for each trade will
appear in turn.
</p>

<h3>Pricing</h3>

<p>
You do not have to price a job immediately. If you
estimate and save quantities of materials on the data
pak you can recall and price the job later.
</p>

<p>
To price a Job whose quantities are already saved, find
the job in question with the <b>FIND</b> key, as described
above. Then press the <b>MODE</b> key until the word <b>PRICE</b>
appears on the screen. Press <b>EXECUTE</b>, and the total
area and quantities required for the job will appear and
maybe priced using &gt;&gt; just as before.
