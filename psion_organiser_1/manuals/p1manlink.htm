<a name="c1"></a><h2>1<br>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>
The Psion Organiser Link-Up pack connects your
Organiser to the rest of the world.

<p>
It has been designed to communicate with
equipment which has communication software
and an RS232 or RS423 port.
<br>It enables you to:
<ul>
<li>send records and files from your datapaks to other computers
<li>print out records and programs from datapaks
<li>receive and store information from other computers
</ul>

<p>
You can use the Organiser to collect and carry
information wherever you travel yet still share a
central database.

<hr>

<a name="c2"></a><h2>2<br>TWO PACKS</h2>

<p>
Link-Up consists of two units:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the <b>Connector pack</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the <b>Software pack</b>.

<p>
The Connector pack looks like a datapak with a
multi-coloured ribbon lead emerging from it. As
you would expect, it is used to physically connect
the Organiser to another device. This pack must be
in place whenever data transfer takes place.

<p>
The Software pack looks like an ordinary
datapak. It contains the programs needed to
control the flow of data to and from your Organiser.
Once these programs have been loaded, the
Software pack does not have to be in the
Organiser for data communication to take place.

<p>
You may wish to use the Link-Up pack to
communicate with another computer or a printer.
For simplicity's sake, let us call the machine you
wish to communicate with the <b>target</b>.
<br>Information can travel from your Organiser to
the target, or from the target to the Organiser.

<p>
There are three operations which you must
perform before communication between your
Organiser and the <b>target</b> can take place.

<table class=indent summary="">
<tr><td>Step&nbsp;1.</td>
<td>The Organiser must be
physically connected to its target.
The <b>Connector pack</b> must be
slotted into the Organiser and the
RS232 interface cable must be
plugged into the target. Chapter
Three explains how to connect the
RS232 interface.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Step&nbsp;2.</td>
<td>The <b>Software pack</b> must be
fitted and the communications
software read into the Organiser.
Chapter Four describes how to load
and unload these programs.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Step&nbsp;3.</td>
<td>The Organiser and target must
be set up with compatible values of
certain essential <b>transmission
parameters</b>. Chapter Five describes
what these parameters are, and how
to match those on your Organiser
link-up pack with those of your target
device.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
After these operations have been performed, you
are ready to send and receive data with the
commands described in Chapter 6.

<p>
Chapter 7 is devoted to a series of examples
which show all these steps.

<p>
When the link-up pack is first used it can take
some time to match the communication needs of
your target computer to those of the Organiser.
The link-up software is designed to let you store
the settings you need so that they can be
automatically loaded the next time you want
communication to take place.

<hr>

<a name="c3"></a><h2>3<br>Connecting the Organiser to the Target</h2>

<p>
The <b>Connector pack</b> can be fitted to either solid
state drive of your Organiser. The socket at the
other end of the Connector pack cable is designed
to connect to equipment using the RS232C and
RS423 communications standards. The rest of this
chapter shows you how to make sure that the
wiring of your target device is compatible with the
Connector pack socket.



<h3>Standards in the microcomputer industry</h3>

<p>
Part of the fascination of the microcomputer
industry is that it was started and has been fuelled
mainly by the invention and industry of talented
individuals. The disadvantage of this is that
talented individuals can rarely agree on a
standard. So it is with the RS232 interface. There
are differences even between connectors which
are supposed to be standard. This chapter
describes the wiring of the connector supplied
with the Link-Up pack, using as little jargon as
possible. Read through this chapter carefully and
compare the wiring of the Link-Up pack with that of
your target device.

<h3>Plugs and sockets</h3>

<p>
The Connector pack cable is terminated with a 25
way 'D' type socket. (It has been wired so that it
will connect directly into an IBM PC.) The socket
has receptacle contacts and must be connected to
a plug, with pin contacts. Figure 3.1 illustrates both
connectors.

<h3>Connecting Up</h3>

<p>
The wiring of the Connector pack socket is shown
in figures 3.2 and 3.3. Figure 3.2 is a table,
showing the functions and positions of the socket
contacts. Figure 3.3 is a diagram of the socket,
with each contact labelled. The wiring pattern of
the socket is known as its pinout.</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Link-Up Pack pinout diagram</b> Figure 3.3

<p>
To connect up the Organiser to the target
equipment you must check that the pinout of the
target RS232 connector matches that of the Link-
Up socket pinout.

<p>
If the wiring is compatible then there is no
problem &mdash; simply plug the link-up pack in and
proceed to use the 'SETUP' command.

<p>
If the wiring is different or the target connector
does not fit the Link-Up pack connector, you will
have to make up an interconnection cable to go
between the Link-Up socket and your equipment.
(Your dealer may be able to supply one). If you buy
an interconnection cable, make sure that it ends
with a 'D' type plug, as shown in figure 3.1.

<h3>The pin settings</h3>

<p>
Although there are 25 contacts on the D type
socket, only five are needed for the Link-Up pack.
Two are used for data, two for control signals and
one is signal ground.

<p>
Data travels from the target to the Organiser on
the TxD line, and from the Organiser to the target
on the RxD line.

<p>
The direction in which your target expects data
to travel depends upon whether it is wired as Data
Communication Equipment (DCE) or Data Terminal
Equipment. A signal which is output for a DCE will
be input for a DTE.

<p>
The Link-Up pack connector is wired as a Data
Communication Equipment (DCE) interface.
Diagrams showing how to connect it to both DTE
and DCE are in Appendix C.

<h3>TxD and RxD</h3>

<p>
TxD is for serial data transmitted to the Organiser
from the target. RXD is data received from the
Organiser. These will normally be used, though for
some printers, RxD only need be connected.

<h3>RTS and CTS</h3>

<p>
The signals on these lines control when data is
sent on the TxD and RxD lines. This control is
known as handshaking, and is described in
chapter 5. The Link-Up pack only uses them if the
RTS/CTS protocol is selected.

<p>
The signal from the Organiser to the target is on
the CTS (clear to send) line of the Link-Up pack.
The signal from the target to the Organiser is on
the RTS (ready to send) line of the Link-Up pack.

<p>
If your target is wired as Data Terminal
Equipment the connections run as you might
expect. CTS on the Link-Up pack socket is
connected to CTS on the target connector, and
similarly for RTS. If, however, your target is wired
as Data Communication Equipment, CTS of the
Link-Up pack must be connected to the RTS pin of
the target, and vice versa. This is all shown in the
diagrams of Appendix C.

<h3>DSR/DTR</h3>

<p>
These signals are not used by the Organiser, but
the relevant pins are connected together on the
Link-Up socket, so that equipment which requires
a 'data set ready' signal will get one whenever it
generates a 'data terminal ready' signal.

<hr>

<a name="c4"></a><h2>4<br>Installing the Communications Software</h2>

<p>
Slot the Software pack into either of the solid state
drives in the back of your Organiser. You should
not have any other program pack (such as the
Finance pack) in your Organiser at the same time.
When you switch on, software to offer two new
commands is automatically loaded.

<p>
You can test to see that it has been loaded by
pressing the <b>MODE/HOME</b> key repeatedly. The
commands available should be
<div class=indent>
<b>ENTER
<br>OFF
<br>SETUP
<br>RESET.</b></div>


<p>
Every time you turn on the Organiser with the Link-
Up Software pack in place you will be offered
these commands.

<p>
The <b>CALC</b> option is not available when using the
Link-Up pack.

<p>
If 'SETUP' is not displayed, this means that the
communications software has not loaded properly.
Try turning the Organiser off and on again, and
check that the Software pack is properly slotted
into position.

<p>
'SETUP' and 'RESET' can only be executed when
the Software pack is in place.
'SETUP' is described in detail in the next
chapter.

<p>
<b>Once the 'SETUP' command has been used,
turning the Organiser off does not dislodge the
communications software. The Organiser can
be turned off and the Software pack removed
without affecting the communications
software.</b>

<p>
'RESET' clears the communications software from
the Organiser and returns it to its normal state.
Select 'RESET' , press <b>EXECUTE</b>, then remove
the Software pack.
<br>Removing the battery or using any other
specialist program pack (such as the Psion
Finance pack) also clears the communication
software.

<p>
When the communications software has been
cleared, you must re-install it before any
further communications can be undertaken.

<hr>

<a name="c5"></a><h2>5<br>Using the 'SETUP' Command</h2>

<p>
Imagine you are tuning in your radio. Out there on
the airwaves, the station you want is transmitting
at a certain frequency on a certain waveband. In
order to hear it you must do two things. You must
find out what this frequency is, then you must
locate it on your dial.
<br>Likewise, before communication can take place
between the Organiser and a target device you
must find out various things about the way in
which the two machines can transfer data, then
use the 'SETUP' command to tell the Organiser
what they are.

<p>
Setting up communication between the Organiser
and a target device is more complicated than
tuning in a radio receiver. The transmission
frequency (or Baud rate) is only one of the settings
you have to make. Because information can be
sent both ways between Organiser and target, you
must set the controls which determine when data
will travel (known as handshaking). Also, since
different machines transmit data in different ways
you must set the pattern of bits sent in each group
of information.

<p>
Because you are in control of both ends of
communication, you must set all these things on
both the Organiser and the target.
<br>Collectively, the settings which must be agreed
between Organiser and target are called
<b>transmission parameters</b>. You must first discover
or set these transmission parameters on the target
machine, then use the 'SETUP' command to tell
the Organiser what they are.
<br>A brief description of each one of these
parameters is given later in this chapter, but it is
not necessary to understand what each one does
in order to use the Link-Up pack. It is important,
however, to make sure that the settings are the
same on both machines.
<br>If your target device is another computer, you
will need to run some sort of communications
program on it to set these parameters. On printers,
these parameters are often set on banks of
switches.
<br>Chapter 6 includes examples of setting these
parameters on certain common computers and
printers.

<p>
Once the parameters you need have been set on
the Organiser they can be saved on the Software
pack so that they automatically appear next time
the communications software is loaded.


<h3>The Default Settings</h3>

<p>
To get into 'SETUP' press the <b>MODE/HOME</b> key
until 'SETUP' appears on the display, then press
the <b>EXECUTE</b> key. The Organiser searches the
Software pack for the last set of parameters saved.
It loads them into its memory, and displays the first
of these on its screen.

<p>
If you are using the Link-Up pack for the first time
the parameters settings will be those shown
below. If you have already used the 'SETUP'
command, the parameters Will be set to the values
you last saved.

<table class=indent summary="">
<tr><td>BAUD       </td><td>9600</td></tr>
<tr><td>PARITY     </td><td>NONE</td></tr>
<tr><td>BITS       </td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>STOP BITS  </td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>HANDSHAKING</td><td>NONE</td></tr>
<tr><td>EOL        </td><td>CRLF (i.e. carriage return, line feed)</td></tr>
<tr><td>EOF        </td><td>1A (ASCII character control-Z)</td></tr>
<tr><td>TRANA      </td><td>BLANK</td></tr>
<tr><td>TRANB      </td><td>BLANK</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
<b>If these default values suit your immediate
target, press the &darr; key until the 'EXIT'
command is displayed then press EXECUTE.</b>
You will then leave 'SETUP' and be ready to send
and receive data as described in Chapter 5. If
these settings are not suitable, they must be edited
from within the 'SETUP' command.

<h3>Changing the Settings</h3>

<p>
Within 'SETUP' the FIND and SAVE keys take on
their alternative meanings, becoming &darr; and &uarr;
respectively, as indicated by the blue arrows below
the keys. Use these keys to move up and down
through the list of parameters and their current
values. Figure 5.1 lists the parameters you can set
in this way, and the values you can choose from in
each case. TRANA and TRANB are the Link-Up
pack's translation commands. They are described
below. Don't worry if there is no equivalent on your
target machine.

<p><b>Transmission Parameters</b>
<br>Figure 5.1

<p>
The parameters are, effectively, arranged in a loop.
For instance, you can move from BAUD to TRANB
either by pressing &uarr; twice or by pressing &darr; eight
times. The values of most of the parameters are
set by a multiple choice system, where you use
the &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; keys to move left and right
through a row of options for that parameter until
the one you want is displayed. The value is now
fixed until you alter it again. For instance, to
change the BAUD rate from 9600 to 4800, press
the &lt;&lt; key once until the display shows
'BAUD:4800'. Now, you can press &uarr; or &darr; to move
on to another parameter.

<p>
The EOL, EOF, TRANA and TRANB parameters
cannot be handled by the multiple choice
approach. To set these you must type in a new
setting from the keyboard. When you have set the
new value, press &uarr; or &darr; to move on to the next
parameter.

<p>
You can set the parameters in any order you
choose. When you wish to accept the setup as it
stands move to the 'EXIT' command and press
<b>EXECUTE</b>. Until you do that, there is no limit to
the number of times you may alter the value of
each parameter.
<br>When you execute 'EXIT' the parameter values
set become effective and remain so for all ensuing
communications, until you replace the setup with
another, or clear the communications software.


<h3>Transmission Parameters Defined</h3>

<h4>BAUD RATE &mdash; BAUD</h4>

<p>
The BAUD rate measures the speed at which lines
of data are transferred. It is sometimes called bits
per second by other communications packages.

<p>
If the BAUD rate is high, the probability of
transmission errors increases. if some of your
characters are not being transferred correctly, try
lowering the BAUD rate on both Organiser and
target.

<p>
It is not always best just to use the highest
BAUD rate available. Many printers print at a much
slower speed than the maximum BAUD rate
available with the Link-Up pack. There is little point
in trying to increase the rate of transfer if the
printer cannot print any faster than it is doing.

<h4>PARITY, DATA &amp; STOP BITS</h4>

<p>
The Organiser can transmit data in groups (known
as frames) of ten or eleven bits. One character of
data is included in each frame.

<p>
The first bit of each group is the start bit. The next
seven or eight bits contain the actual data. Then
there may be a bit known as the parity bit. Lastly,
there will be one or two stop bits.

<p>
The 'PARlTY', 'BITS' and 'STOP' commands
allow you to specify the data frame you need.

<p>
Figure 5.2 shows all the possible ways of
combining start, data, parity and stop bits in a
frame of ten or eleven bits.

<p>
Simple addition will reveal that two
combinations are not allowed. Seven data, no
parity and one stop bit is an illegal combination. It
would leave only nine bits in the data frame.
Similarly eight data bits, two stop bits and a parity
bit is an illegal combination, because it would lead
to a data frame of twelve bits.
The Link-Up pack will not allow either of these
combinations to be set.

<b>Legal Data Frames</b>
<br>Figure 5.2



<h4>PARITY &mdash; PAR</h4>

<p>
A parity bit is a bit added to the data frame by the
transmitting device. It helps the receiving device
check whether the data has arrived correctly.
<br>There are several different types of parity
checking in use. The four which the Link-Up pack
can understand and accept are shown in figure
5.1.
<br>If your target device uses parity checking, make
sure that your Organiser 'SETUP' uses the same
type of parity checking as the target device. Select
the appropriate type using &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;.

<p>
If your target does not allow parity checking,
select parity NONE on your 'SETUP'. If you do not
use parity checking, the parity bit is not included in
the data frame, allowing you to include one more
data or stop bit.


<h4>DATA BITS &mdash; BITS</h4>

<p>
This command allows you to set the number of
data bits, in each frame.
<br>As stated above, the length of each frame may
be ten or eleven bits. Of these only seven or eight
contain the information you want to transfer. The
others are the start bit, stop bit(s) and the optional
parity bit. With the &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; keys you may set
the number of data bits to be seven or eight.

<p>
Some manufacturers include the parity bit in their
definition of the data bits. This means that they
would call seven data bits and a parity bit eight
data bits. Check the definition of data bits used by
your target device in its documentation.

<p>
Seven bits of data (not including the parity bit) is
the most common number of bits used in data
communication. All characters used in the
Organiser can be represented with seven bits.
<br>Some systems are set up to expect eight bits
per character, and to allow communication with
such devices the Link-Up pack will accept and
transmit data frames with eight data bits.

<p>
In the Organiser, as in all computers, the
characters which appear on the screen are
represented by numbers inside the machine. For
instance. the letter 'A' is represented by the
number 65, 'B' by 66 etc. The most common code
by which characters are represented is known as
the American Standard Code for the Interchange
of Information; ASCII. All ASCII characters can be
represented with seven bits.
<br>When the Organiser stores characters the data
is compressed. Only ASCII characters between 32
(20 hex) and 95 (5F hex) can be saved on the
Organiser. (Because of this data compression, the
Organiser actually stores up to 10,900 characters
on an 8k datapak). The character set used by the
Organiser is shown by the table in Appendix A.
<br>When data is received by the Link-Up pack,
lower case ASCII characters will be transferred to
upper case, and any other characters not in the
specified range are filtered out.


<h4>STOP BITS &mdash; STOP</h4>

<p>
Stop bits mark the end of the data frame. Some
systems use one stop bit, others require two. The
Link-Up pack allows you to choose either option
using the &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; keys. Remember, however,
that the total number of bits in a frame must be ten
or eleven. The six combinations of bits which
satisfy all the conditions are shown in figure 5.2.


<h4>HANDSHAKING &mdash; HAND</h4>

<p>
Data can only be transmitted when one device is
ready to transmit and the other is ready to receive.
Handshaking is a technique which ensures that
this happens. It is another safety check on data
transfer.
<br>Three handshaking options are offered by the
Link-Up pack. They are RTS/CTS, XON/XOFF or
NONE. Choose the type of handshaking used by
your target device. If it does not support RTS/CTS
or XON/XOFF you will have to choose NONE.


<h4>END OF LINE &mdash; EOL</h4>

<p>
Organiser marks the end of each record saved so
it will be able to tell where that one ends and the
next begins. Whether it is sending or receiving
data, the Organiser must know which character or
characters is to be used as the end of line marker.
<br>The end of line marker may be up to three
characters long. The most common characters
used may be specified by typing in a standard
abbreviation for them. Other characters may be
specified by their 2 digit hexadecimal ASCII code
Hence you may enter up to three pairs of digits
from the keyboard in the EOL option of the
'SETUP' command.
<br>The Characters for which abbreviations exist
are:<b>
<br>CR (ASCII code 0D hex) -carriage return;
<br>LF (ASCII Code 0A hex) -line feed;
<br>FF (ASCII code 0C hex) -form feed;</b>

<p>
Most computers use the combination CRLF
(carriage return, line feed) to end a line. If you are in
doubt what to enter for EOL, use this combination.


<h4>END OF FILE &mdash; EOF</h4>

<p>
This is the signal that the Organiser and target will
interpret as the end of the file or batch of data it is
transmitting. As with the EOL marker, you can
enter up to three pairs of ASCII codes or the
abbreviations CR, LF and FF.
<br>ASCII value 1A (character control-Z) is used as
the end of file marker by most microcomputer
systems. If you are in doubt as to what to enter for
EOF, then use 1A.


<h4>TRANSLATE -- TRANA and TRANB</h4>

<p>
In most data communications, information is
transferred literally. In some cases however, you
may wish to substitute one character for another
while data transfer is taking place. The translation
commands 'TRANA' and 'TRANB' allow you to do
this.
<br>Enter your chosen character(s) (specified in
ASCII as for EOL and EOF) next to the 'TRANA:'
indicator, and move on to 'TRANB:' by pressing &darr;.
When the Organiser is <b><i>sending</i></b> data to a target, it
looks for any occurrences of the character you
entered for 'TRANA' and transmits the 'TRANB'
characters instead. Conversely, whenever it
<b><i>receives</i></b> your 'TRANB' character(s) the Organiser
replaces them with those you entered in 'TRANA'.

<p>
For example.
<br>If you had saved an address on the Organiser
with its street, town etc. separated by colons you
might enter a 3A in 'TRANA' and CR in 'TRANB'
so that any colons in a record would be
transmitted as a carriage return. If the EOL marker
is CR on the target device, the name, street, town
etc will be displayed on the target on separate
lines.

<p>
You can of course leave the 'TRANA' and 'TRANB'
sections blank if you do not need an extra
translation.


<h3>Leaving Set-Up</h3>

<p>
The 'EXlT' command leaves 'SETUP'. 'EXlT' has
two options: 'SAVE' and 'NO SAVE'.

<p>
When you come to the 'EXIT' command, the 'NO
SAVE' option will be displayed. if you are likely to
use your 'SETUP' several times, use the &gt;&gt; or
&lt;&lt; key to select the 'SAVE' option before
pressing <b>EXECUTE</b>. If you save your setup, it will
appear as the default next time the
communications software is loaded.
<br>If you have not changed the settings of any
parameter or if the setup you have created will
only be used once, select the 'NO SAVE' Option.

<p>
After using the 'EXIT' command you can turn on
the Organiser and remove the Software pack
without disturbing the parameter settings you have
made.

<hr>

<a name="c6"></a><h2>6<br>Sending and Receiving Data</h2>

<p>
When you have matched the hardware
connections and software parameters as
described in the previous two chapters you are
ready to transmit data. The Link-Up pack's
communication options are easy to select and
self-explanatory in use. However, you must make
sure that your target device is instructed to receive
or send at the correct time.

<p>
If you are talking to someone on the telephone, you
rely on the other person to say the right words at
the right time, in order to smooth the path of
communication between you.
<br>If the other person became totally silent, or
worse, suddenly started incanting curses in a
foreign language, you would become confused and
your ability to communicate would disappear.
<br>The Link-Up pack also expects certain things
from its target. You may have to type in some sort
of receive command on your target before using a
send command on the Organiser. If you type in the
wrong command, or no command at all, the Link-
Up pack may find itself trying to send information
to a machine which does not want to listen, or
waiting for information from a machine which has
not been instructed to send. In these
circumstances it may get stuck.
<br>If this happens, press the <b>ON/CLEAR</b> key to
free the Link-Up pack software, then find out what
command is needed at your target. If you are
communicating with another computer, you will
usually have to type in a command on your target
to match each sending or receiving command
used on the Organiser.


<h3>Send and Receive Commands</h3>

<p>
Press the <b>MODE/HOME</b> key several times. If the
Connector pack is in place the commands 'SENDL'
and 'RECL' should be displayed, along with the
normal 'ENTER' and 'OFF' commands. 'SENDL'
stands for send line. 'RECL' stands for receive
line.
<br>If the Software pack has been removed and
replaced with a datapak, 'SENDF', 'SENDF' and
'RECF' should also be displayed in the command
cycle. 'SENDF' stands for send file, 'SENDP' for
send program and 'RECF' for receive file.
<br>Even if the Software pack has been removed.
the communications software is still resident in the
Organiser until removed with the 'RESET'
command. It checks which packs are fitted to the
solid state drives before offering commands to the
user. If no datapak is in place, files cannot be sent
or received. If the Connector pack is not in place
you cannot send lines or files and only the 'OFF'
and 'ENTER' commands can be selected.


<h4>SENDL -- Sending a line</h4>

<p>
This command is for sending the current line of
information. First make sure your target is ready to
receive. Type the line or find the record you want to
send. Press the <b>MODE/HOME</b> key until 'SENDL'
appears on the screen, then press <b>EXECUTE</b>. You
can edit the line before or after the transmission,
though of course you will only transmit the version
that is current when you press <b>EXECUTE</b>.


<h4>SENDF &mdash; Sending a file</h4>

<p>
'SENDF' allows you to send all the records, or a
selected group of records from a datapak.

<p>
If you execute 'SENDF', you will be offered a
choice of ALL (press A) or QUERY (press Q. If you
choose ALL, all the records on your datapak will
be transmitted without interruption. In this case
the records will not be displayed as they are found,
since that would delay the transmission, but they
will flash past as they are transmitted. If you select
QUERY by pressing Q, the Organiser displays
each record it finds and waits for you to press
<b>EXECUTE</b> to confirm the instruction before it
sends that record to the target. Press N if you do
not wish to transmit the record which is displayed.
The next record is presented for your confirmation
in the usual way. With the QUERY option you can
read through each record and stop and start the
progression of characters across the display just
as you can with any retrieved record in 'FlND'.
You can stop the process by pressing <b>ON/CLEAR</b>.
<br>If you press <b>ON/CLEAR</b> while the Organiser has
just finished sending a record, the Link-Up pack
software will return to the main command loop
immediately. While the Organiser is in the middle
of sending a record, it cannot look to see if the
<b>ON/CLEAR</b> key has been pressed. You must keep
pressing the key until the end of a record is
reached. The Organiser will then be able to read
the clear signal and stop transmission.

<p>
This is not all that the 'SENDF' command can do.
After selecting 'SENDF', you can enter a string of
characters in the display area. If you then press
<b>EXECUTE</b>, the Organiser will send records
containing that string to the target device. Once
again you are asked if you want to send ALL
records containing this string, or whether you want
to scrutinise each record individually with the
QUERY feature.
<br>The 'SENDF' command has similarities with the
normal 'FIND' command. If you press <b>EXECUTE</b>
without specifying a search string, it acts on all the
records in the datapak. If you enter a search
string, it acts on all the records containing that
string.


<h4>SENDP &mdash; Sending a program</h4>

<p>
This command enables you to transmit programs
or procedures that you have written and saved in a
datapak.
<br>As with the 'SENDF' command, you are allowed
to send ALL programs saved on a datapak (type A)
or QUERY each program before it is sent (type Q).
<br>Alternatively, you may select 'SENDP' and type
the name of the program you wish to transmit.
before pressing <b>EXECUTE</b>.

<p>
'SENDP' can only be used to send programs on
the currently fitted datapak. You cannot use the
Connector pack and a specialist Program pack
together. Indeed, fitting one of the specialist
Program packs containing the programming
language POPL will clear the communications
software from your Organiser as soon as you
switch on.
<br>If you wish to send a program contained on a
program pack, you must first save that program
onto a datapak. You cannot save a program twice
under the same name, so you will have to save it
under a different name on the datapak.


<h4>RECL &mdash; Receiving a line of information</h4>

<p>
This command enables the Organiser to receive
up to two hundred characters of information from
the target device. The data sent must be specified
by a command from the target. When the target
starts to transmit, the Organiser receives the
transmitted information as the current line, and you
can choose to save it, using the SAVE key (editing
it first if you wish), or clear it.
<br>Once 'RECL' has been executed, the Organiser
will continue to expect to receive data until it
receives an end of line character. If your target
device does not transmit the correct end of line
character, press <b>ON/CLEAR</b> to reset the
Organiser software.

<h4>RECF &mdash; Receiving a file of information</h4>

<p>
If you execute this command the Link-Up pack will
receive a file from the target and store it on a
datapak. Again the data to be transmitted will be
specified at the target and must end with a proper
end of file-character. If the target device does not
transmit the end of file character correctly, try
typing the EOF character in at its keyboard (if it
has one), or use the <b>ON/CLEAR</b> key to reset the
Organiser software.

<p>
If more than two hundred characters appear
without an EOL code amongst them, the Organiser
will start a new record in the datapak at the 201st
character. For instance, if your 'SETUP' defines
EOL as the ASCII code for a full stop, it is wise to
ensure that the file does not contain any unusually
long sentences before you transmit it to the
Organiser. Any sentences containing more than
two hundred characters will overflow into at least
two records in the datapak.

<p>
When the data transfer is complete, the RECF
indicator reappears.

<hr>

<a name="c7"></a><h2>7<br>Examples</h2>

<p>
This chapter consists of examples which show
how to connect the Link-Up pack to various target
devices. Obviously it has not been possible to
include every computer and printer in this chapter,
but even if your target is not described in this
chapter, you may still find the examples helpful.

<h3>Microcomputers</h3>

<p>
On most microcomputers you will need to run
some sort of program which performs a similar
function to the 'SETUP' command. it will set the
parameters such as baud rate, parity checking etc.
This may be a commercially marketed
communications package or a program you have
written yourself. Alternatively the commands to set
the transmission parameters can often be
accessed from the operating system, and can be
executed one by one.


<h3>The IBM PC</h3>

<h4>The Hardware Interface</h4>

<p>
The Link-Up pack interface is wired so that it
connects directly with the PC Asynchronous
Communication card.


<h4>Matching the Software Parameters</h4>

<p>
Appendix B includes the full listing of a BASIC
program called "ORGCOMM.BAS". When run,
ORGCOMM.BAS sets up the PC as follows:
<table class = indent summary="">
<tr><td>BAUD       </td><td>9600</td></tr>
<tr><td>PARITY     </td><td>NONE</td></tr>
<tr><td>BITS       </td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>STOP BITS  </td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>HAND       </td><td>RTS/CTS</td></tr>
<tr><td>EOL        </td><td>CRLF</td></tr>
<tr><td>EOF        </td><td>1ACRLF</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Alternatively, if you already possess a
communications package for the PC, you may wish
to use that. Many different communication
packages are available for the PC. One well known
package is "Crosstalk" produced by Microstuf.
This section describes data transfer using
Crosstalk with the Link-Up pack.

<p>
Using Crosstalk, the communication parameters
which must be matched are displayed on the left
hand side of the Crosstalk status screen. To
change the baud rate (line speed) type the
command 'SP 9600'. Crosstalk must be set to half
duplex. A possible 'SETUP' would be
<table class = indent summary="">
<tr><td>BAUD       </td><td>9600</td></tr>
<tr><td>PARITY     </td><td>NONE</td></tr>
<tr><td>BITS       </td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>STOP BITS  </td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>HAND       </td><td>NONE</td></tr>
<tr><td>EOL        </td><td>CRLF</td></tr>
<tr><td>EOF        </td><td>1A</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Carriage return and line feed are the characters
used for delimiting the end of a line on almost all
microcomputers. Similarly the control-Z character
(ASCII 1A) is normally used for end of file.
<br>The transmission parameters of the IBM may be
set at any time while Crosstalk is running. The
transmission parameters of the Organiser must be
set with the 'SETUP' command. before
communication takes place.

<h4>Sending and Receiving Data Using ORGCOMM.BAS</h4>

<p>
ORGCOMM.BAS show the options to send and
receive files on the screen of your PC. Remember
to use the receive option of ORGCOMM before the
send command on the Organiser, and vice versa.


<h4>Sending and Receiving Data Using Crosstalk</h4>

<p>
If no previous command has been entered on the
PC, Crosstalk is ready to receive. If the status
screen is not displayed, all data received will be
displayed on the screen of the PC. If you want to
save data to disk, use Crosstalk's capture
command. Send lines and files from the Organiser
to the PC by executing the relevant commands on
the Organiser.
<br>To send a line of data from the PC to the
Organiser, execute the RECL command on the
Organiser, then type a line at the PC keyboard.
When the return key of the PC is pressed, the line
should appear on the Organiser screen.



<h3>ACT Apricot</h3>

<p>
Much of the following description of
communication with the Apricot, also applies for
communication with Sirius or Victor computers.


<h4>The hardware interface</h4>

<p>
The centre port of the ACT Apricot is an RS232
interface. The pin settings of this port and the Link-
Up pack interface are identical but both have
socket connectors. An interconnection cable with
a plug connector at both ends is needed.


<h4>Matching the software parameters</h4>

<p>
The ACT Apricot comes with a standard
communications package &mdash; "ASYNC". Run ASYNC
while you are creating a setup, and you will be able
to set the software parameters on both the Apricot
and the Organiser.
<br>To use Link-Up with the Apricot, you must
choose the user specified terminal option of
ASYNC's main menu. You can then set the Baud
rate (line speed), the parity convention, the number
of data and stop bits and whether you want
XON/XOFF handshaking.
<br>Note that if you want XON/XOFF handshaking
on the Apricot, you must set the receive and send
parameters separately. On the Link-Up pack,
handshaking for both sending and receiving is set
with one command. XON/XOFF is the only form of
handshaking possible with ASYNC.
<br>Apricot already accepts ASCII 1A as an end of
file, and CR, LF as an end of line marker.


<h4>Sending and Receiving Data</h4>

<p>
Start terminal operation by selecting the relevant
option of ASYNC. Press <b>MODE/HOME</b> on the
Organiser until 'SENDL' appears on the screen,
then type a few characters on the keyboard. Press
<b>EXECUTE</b> and the characters will be displayed on
the screen of the Apricot.
<br>If you have replaced your Software pack with a
datapak, you will be able to send and receive files
as well as lines of information. In order to send
files from the Apricot, set the Organiser to receive,
then select the send option from the microscreen
menu.



<h3>Sinclair QL</h3>


<h4>The hardware interface</h4>

<p>
The QL has two serial ports. Use the second serial
port, SER2, for communications with the Link-Up
pack. Sinclair supply a cable which connects the
QL port to a 'D' type plug. One change must be
made to the wiring. Pin 20 on the QL must be
connected to pin 4 on the Link-Up pack socket.


<h4>The Software Parameters</h4>

<p>
Use the following setup on the Organiser:
<table class = indent summary="">
<tr><td>BAUD       </td><td>1200</td></tr>
<tr><td>PARITY     </td><td>NONE</td></tr>
<tr><td>BITS       </td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>STOP BITS  </td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>HAND       </td><td>RTS/CTS</td></tr>
<tr><td>EOL        </td><td>CRLF</td></tr>
<tr><td>EOF        </td><td>1A</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The baud rate on the QL can be set by a QDOS
command. Type 'BAUD 1200' to set the baud rate
to 1200.
<br>The QL defaults to no parity, 8 data bits, 2 stop
bits and RTS/CTS handshaking, so you do not need
to do anything in order set these.
<br>In order to set the end of file marker to control-Z
and the end of line marker to CR, use the 'c' option
of the open or copy command, as shown in the
next section.


<h4>Sending and Receiving Data</h4>

<p>
Example One &mdash; to send a line from the QL to the
Organiser.

<p>
Setup the Organiser with the parameters listed
above. Execute the 'RECL' command on the
Organiser.

<p>
On the QL, type:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OPEN #5, SER2C
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT #5,"Information"

<p>
The word "Information" will be displayed on the
screen of the Organiser. A named string may also
be sent to the Organiser: e.g.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT #5,a$
<br>The extra 'c' after ser2 specifies the EOL and EOF
characters for the QL. Do not forget to close
channel five when you have finished
communication.

<p>
Example Two &mdash; to send a file from the Organiser to
the QL.

<p>
The QDOS copy command can be used to read
in a file without opening a channel. To send the
whole contents of a datapak to a file named FRED
on microdrive 2 on the OL, type in the QDOS
command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COPY SER2C TO MDV2_FRED_EXP
<br>then execute 'SENDF' on the Organiser.



<h3>BBC Model B</h3>

<h4>Hardware Interface</h4>

<p>
The BBC micro has an RS423 serial port with five
contacts. A special lead must be made up to
connect this port with the Link-Up pack. A diagram
of the BBC RS423 port pinout is given in the BBC
user guide. The pins must be connected as
follows:
<table summary="">
<tr><td>Link-Up pack</td><td>BBC RS423</td></tr>
<tr><td>RxD         </td><td>Data in</td></tr>
<tr><td>TxD         </td><td>Data out</td></tr>
<tr><td>RTS         </td><td>RTS</td></tr>
<tr><td>CTS         </td><td>CTS</td></tr>
<tr><td>0v          </td><td>0v</td></tr>
</table>



<h4>Software matching</h4>

<p>
Use the following 'SETUP':
<table class=indent summary="">
<tr><td>BAUD       </td><td>9600</td></tr>
<tr><td>PARITY     </td><td>NONE</td></tr>
<tr><td>BITS       </td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>STOP BITS  </td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>HAND       </td><td>NONE</td></tr>
<tr><td>EOL        </td><td>CRLF</td></tr>
<tr><td>EOF        </td><td>1A</td></tr>
</table>
Use the *FX commands on the BBC to open
transmission channels and set the Baud rate to
9600.

<p>
If you wish to transmit data from the Organiser to
the BBC type:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*FX7,7
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*FX2,1

<p>
If you wish to transmit data from the BBC to the
Organiser type:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*FX8,7
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*FX3,1

<p>
Data can then be transferred between the
Organiser the BBC screen.



<h3>Printers</h3>

<p>
The Link-Up pack always uses serial data
transmission. Some dot-matrix printers only have
parallel ports as standard.
<br>In contrast, daisywheel printers almost always
use serial transmission. On most printers,
transmission parameters are set by DIP switches
which are small switches commonly found under
the front cover of the printer.


<h3>Epson FX 80</h3>

<p>
Your Epson needs an optional serial interface card
to communicate with Link-Up.

<h4>Hardware Interface</h4>

<p>
A special interconnection cable must be made up
to join the Link-Up pack and the Epson FX 80. The
Epson only needs three connections to be made.

<p>
These are:
<table summary="">
<tr><td>Link-Up pack</td><td>Epson</td></tr>
<tr><td>3 </td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>4 </td><td>11</td></tr>
<tr><td>7 </td><td>7</td></tr>
</table>


<h4>Transmission parameters</h4>

<p>
The transmission parameters of the Epson are set
by dip switches on the serial interface card. As the
meanings and settings of these switches may vary
between different versions of the serial interface
card, you must consult the manual to your
interface. It should be possible to set the switches
to match the following 'SETUP':
<table class=indent summary="">
<tr><td>BAUD       </td><td>2400</td></tr>
<tr><td>PARITY     </td><td>NONE</td></tr>
<tr><td>BITS       </td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>STOP BITS  </td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>HAND       </td><td>RTS/CTS</td></tr>
<tr><td>EOL        </td><td>CRLF</td></tr>
<tr><td>EOF        </td><td>1A</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
When this 'SETUP' has been created you can send
lines, files or programs to the printer using the
usual commands.

<p>
Like most microcomputers the Organiser
represents characters internally with ASCII code.
The following table shows the decimal and
hexadecimal representations of each character
used by the Organiser.
<br>Lower case letters received by the Link-Up pack
will be translated into upper-case. Other
characters outside the range 32 (20 hex) and 95
(5F) hex will be filtered out.
<br>Note that ASCII character 95 (5F hex) is used
internally by the Organiser as an end of line
marker. It cannot be read by the Link-Up pack.

<br>DTE and DCE wiring</h2>

<p>
The Link-Up pack is wired as Data
Communications Equipment. This means that the
RxD and CTS connectors are output for the
Organiser. The convention is designed so that DCE
connectors join directly to DTE connectors.
<br>If your target is wired as Data Terminal
Equipment, RxD and CTS will be inputs for your
target.
<br>If your target is wired as Data Communication
Equipment, the RxD and CTS of the Organiser
must be connected to the TxD and RTS of the
target.
<br>The diagrams below show the direction of data
flow and the connections to be made between the
Organiser and DTE or DCE ports.
