<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The Psion Organiser that you have just purchased is a
computer for your pocket - an expandable system with a
microprocessor significantly more advanced than those
commonly found in micros 200 times its size.

</p><p>Your Organiser has two unique and versatile 'solid-state
drives' concealed under its protective sliding case, and
these matchbox-sized units are key to the open-ended
power of the Organiser.

</p><p>Supplied with your Organiser in one of these drives, is a
datapak which can permanently store over 10,000
characters, allowing you to use it for such information as
diary engagements. telephone numbers, expenses,
train times and exchange rates.

</p><p>Additional datapaks allow you to create an infinitely large
and secure personal information base, which, when
used in conjunction with program packs from the
software library, provides unbeatable processing power
in your pocket.

</p><p>The Organiser is also a sophisticated calculator, and
can carry out complex calculations involving up to 200
characters and two levels of brackets. You may enter
and edit both data and formulae exactly as you would
write them.

</p><p>So thanks to your Psion Organiser, you can now walk
around quite comfortably with a computer in your
pocket.

GETTING STARTED</h2>

<h3>Fitting The Battery</h3>

<p>Your Organiser uses any 9 Volt PP3 size battery. For a
longer operating life the use of alkaline or re-chargeable
batteries is recommended. You should not use a mains
adaptor because it may damage your Organiser

</p><p>Grip the protective case (Fig. 2.3) just below the
separation point (Fig.2.4) and pull it firmly downwards
until it comes right off the Organiser. Find the tab of the
battery cover at the back of the Organiser (Fig.1.5). Pull
the tab to remove the cover, and tip out the battery
connector. Connect the battery and tuck it well into its
compartment. To replace the battery cover slip its lip into
its corresponding groove just inside the battery
compartment. Clip the tab into place and your
Organiser is ready for use.


</p><h3>The Keyboard</h3>

<p>Look at the keyboard before you continue. Most of the
keys have labels above and below them. The SHIFT
key allows you to move between the alphabet shown in
white, and the numbers and symbols shown in yellow.
The blue symbols shown below some keys are only for
use with program packs.

</p><div align="center">
<img src="./Psion Organiser 1 Manual - Jaap&#39;s Psion Organiser II Page_files/c2a.gif" width="450" height="467" alt="The keyboard">
</div>

<p>The first two keys on the top row of the keyboard

</p><div align="center">
<img src="./Psion Organiser 1 Manual - Jaap&#39;s Psion Organiser II Page_files/keyon.gif" width="96" height="96" alt="ON/CLEAR">
<img src="./Psion Organiser 1 Manual - Jaap&#39;s Psion Organiser II Page_files/keymode.gif" width="96" height="96" alt="MODE/HOME">
</div>

<p>have a red label above and below them, to indicate the
different effects each can produce, depending on when
you press it. These keys will be referred to as
ON/CLEAR and MODE/HOME respectively.

</p><p>This booklet gives you the relevant information about the
keys, as you need it. For a summary of key functions see
the reference section.



</p><h3>Switching On</h3>

<p>Press the ON/CLEAR key, the top left hand key on the
keyboard. The clock display will appear in the window
If you cannot see it you may need to adjust the contrast,
using the contrast control wheel (see Figure 1.3.)
Experiment to find the setting that suits you best. (If you
accidentally press another key as well as ONICLEAR
you will see a different display. In that case press
ON/CLEAR once or twice to recover the clock display.)

</p><p>If the message "LOW BATTERY" appears when you
switch on, the battery voltage is too low and you need to
fit a new one as soon as possible. Pressing ON/CLEAR
clears the message, and produces the clock display.
Incidentally, the clock runs for fifteen seconds after the
battery is disconnected (provided the machine was
switched off first), so you need not reset it if you connect
the new battery within this period.

</p><hr>

<a name="c3"></a><h2>3<br>
CLOCK SETTING</h2>

<p>Reading from left to right the clock display shows the
time (by the twenty-tour hour clock) in hours, minutes
and seconds, and the date.  As soon as the battery is
connected, the clock starts running from midnight on
December 31st. The time you see in the display
depends on the time elapsed since you fitted the
battery.

</p><div align="center">
<img src="./Psion Organiser 1 Manual - Jaap&#39;s Psion Organiser II Page_files/c3a.gif" width="450" height="406" alt="The clock display">
</div>

<p>To set the time and date you simply edit the clock
display. Press either of the chevron keys, &lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt; and
a dash, called a cursor, appears under the hours in the
display.

</p><div align="center"><img src="./Psion Organiser 1 Manual - Jaap&#39;s Psion Organiser II Page_files/c3b.gif" width="288" height="42" alt="00:09:12 JAN 1  "></div>

<p>You can move the cursor between the various segments
of the display with the chevron keys. &gt;&gt; moves it to the
right, and &lt;&lt; moves it to the left.

</p><p>Position the cursor beneath the segment you want to
alter. Now press A to advance that segment by one unit.
Because the clock is still running, what you do to one
segment affects the others as natural updating occurs
between seconds and minutes, minutes and hours etc.
For example, if you press A when the cursor us under the
minutes in this display

</p><div align="center"><img src="./Psion Organiser 1 Manual - Jaap&#39;s Psion Organiser II Page_files/c3c.gif" width="288" height="42" alt="00:59:02 JAN 1  "></div>

<p>the display automatically changes to

</p><div align="center"><img src="./Psion Organiser 1 Manual - Jaap&#39;s Psion Organiser II Page_files/c3d.gif" width="288" height="42" alt="01:00:02 JAN 1  "></div>

<p>If you want to stop the clock to prevent this natural
updating, press B. Now you can alter each segment
independently.

</p><p>When you are ready to move on, press ON/CLEAR.
Organiser will clear the cursor from the clock display
and the clock resumes normal running.


</p><p>Clock setting continued

</p><div class="boxed"><div class="margin">
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p>Pressing &lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt; when the clock display is
present selects clock setting and brings in the
cursor.

        Then

</p><p>Pressing &lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt; moves the cursor left or right
Pressing A adds one unit to the section of the
display above the cursor.
Pressing ON/CLEAR returns the clock to normal
running, and removes the cursor
Pressing B stops the clock, until the next time
ONICLEAR is pressed.

SWITCHING OFF</h2>

<p>Press the MODE/HOME key repeatedly until 'OFF:_' is
displayed. If you now press EXECUTE the display will
disappear and the machine is off. (Press ON/CLEAR to
switch it on again.) If the Organiser is left on for five
minutes without any keys being pressed it will switch
itself off.

</p><p>For instance:

<a name="c5"></a><h2>5<br>
BASIC CONCEPTS</h2>

<p>The Organiser is a microcomputer dedicated to
handling your vital day-to-day information in a powerful
but simple way. Information is treated in single discrete
lines, each line being up to two hundred characters long
and containing any combination of letters, numbers,
symbols and spaces. You can think of it as a list of items
on an oversized notepad, each item on a new line.

</p><p>Manipulating this information is simplicity itself. Select an
activity, such as 'SAVE' or 'FIND' which is then indicated
to the left of the current line, and press EXECUTE to
action it. In this way, your information can be stored in
total security in a removable datapak (see Figure 1.1)
from which it can be retrieved whenever required. Each
line stored in your datapak is called a record.

</p><p>When you look at the display (see Figure 2.1) you are
effectively looking through a window at the current line
of information. Using the &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; keys, you can
move this window back and forth along the line to view
any part of it.

</p><p>For example your display might look like thus:

</p><div align="center"><p><img src="./Psion Organiser 1 Manual - Jaap&#39;s Psion Organiser II Page_files/c5a.gif" width="288" height="42" alt="NDON NW1 6OG TEL"></p></div>


<p>when the line contains a full London address and
telephone number.

</p><h3>Communication</h3>

<p>Organiser keeps you informed via the display, while you
communicate with the Organiser using the keyboard.

</p><hr>

<a name="c6"></a><h2>6<br>
OPERATING FRAMEWORK</h2>

<h3>Menu of Activities</h3>

<p>The activities available are:

</p><table summary="">
<tbody><tr><td>`ENTER'</td><td>for general purpose information entry and editing</td></tr>
<tr><td>'SAVE'</td><td>for saving your information permanently in a removable cartridge called a datapak</td></tr>
<tr><td>'FIND'</td><td>for retrieving records you have saved, providing access via any aspect of their contents</td></tr>
<tr><td>'CALC'</td><td>for calculations; allows you to alter the contents before and after execution</td></tr>
<tr><td>'OFF'</td><td>for switching your Organiser off</td></tr>
<tr><td>'ERASE'</td><td>for cancelling records - only available when appropriate.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>These provide powerful information storage and
retrieval facilities as well as a sophisticated calculator.
Further activities and specialist functions are available
through special program packs. For details see the list
of available extensions, enclosed with your Organiser.


</p><h3>Selecting An Activity</h3>

<p>Organiser reserves a space to the left of the information
line for an indication of the current activity. This indicator
is separated by a colon from the contents of the line.

</p><p>The most important activities 'SAVE' and 'FIND' are
selected by pressing the SAVE and FIND keys
respectively. The others are selected by pressing the
MODE/HOME key. Press MODE/HOME repeatedly
now to take the Organiser round a succession of
activities. Watch the indicator change from:

</p><div align="center"><p><img src="./Psion Organiser 1 Manual - Jaap&#39;s Psion Organiser II Page_files/c6a.gif" width="288" height="42" alt="ENTER:_         "></p></div>

<p>to

</p><div align="center"><p><img src="./Psion Organiser 1 Manual - Jaap&#39;s Psion Organiser II Page_files/c4b.gif" width="288" height="42" alt="  OFF:_         "></p></div>

<p>then

</p><div align="center"><p><img src="./Psion Organiser 1 Manual - Jaap&#39;s Psion Organiser II Page_files/c6c.gif" width="288" height="42" alt=" CALC:_         "></p></div>

<p>back to

</p><div align="center"><p><img src="./Psion Organiser 1 Manual - Jaap&#39;s Psion Organiser II Page_files/c6a.gif" width="288" height="42" alt="ENTER:_         "></p></div>

<p>and so on.

</p><p>An activity is current as soon as its indicator appears.
However, that only shows what the Organiser intends to
do with your line of information. To convert that intention
to action, you must press EXECUTE.

</p><p>Organiser allows you to choose various activities in turn,
using the MODE/HOME and SAVE keys, while it holds
the current line of information ready to be processed in
each of the ways you choose. Your line of information
can be anything: data to be stored; a record just
retrieved; or a calculation to be performed. Whatever it
is, Organiser assumes you want to continue using the
same line until you signify otherwise by pressing FIND
or ON/CLEAR, or by switching off.

</p><p>The current line is not visible when 'OFF' is selected, but
reappears in the next appropriate activity. However,
when you actually switch the machine off it forgets the
current line. Any information you want to keep must he
saved beforehand.

</p><hr>

<a name="c7"></a><h2>7<br>
EXECUTE</h2>

<p>EXECUTE is the action key. Organiser waits for you to
press EXECUTE before it carries out a calculation,
saves or finds a record, or switches off, according to
which of these activities you have selected.

</p><p>Remember that actioning 'SAVE' with the EXECUTE
key will make a permanent record of the current line in
your datapak.

</p><div class="boxed"><div class="margin">
<p>With these basic concepts in mind, you can
choose to experiment, or read on for detailed
instructions.
</p></div></div>

<p>&nbsp;

</p><hr>

<a name="c8"></a><h2>8<br>
'ENTER'</h2>

<div align="center"><p><img src="./Psion Organiser 1 Manual - Jaap&#39;s Psion Organiser II Page_files/c6a.gif" width="288" height="42" alt="ENTER:_         "></p></div>

<p>'ENTER' is the neutral activity and can be used for
entering and editing information before selecting an
activity such as 'SAVE' or 'CALC'. Pressing EXECUTE
with 'ENTER' selected has no effect.

</p><hr>

<a name="c9"></a><h2>9<br>
INFORMATION EDITING</h2>

<p>Full information editing is available with all activities. For
convenience editing is described here with reference to
'ENTER'.

</p><p>Press MODE/HOME repeatedly until 'ENTER:_' is
displayed. The cursor appears to the right at of the activity
indicator. This is your invitation to type something. As an
example you could type your name and address. Press
any key whose upper label is one letter of the alphabet
to produce that letter in the display, in the position
currently marked by the cursor. To enter a space, press
SPACE. Don't forget, you need to press SHIFT to type
any of the numbers and symbols shown in yellow under
the keys. The cursor flashes to indicate the change, and
to return to the alphabet you must press SHIFT again.

</p><p>For example to enter 'ANN.28 NOV' you need to press
the following keys:-

</p><div align="center"><p><img src="./Psion Organiser 1 Manual - Jaap&#39;s Psion Organiser II Page_files/c6a.gif" width="288" height="42" alt="ENTER:_         "></p></div>

<p>Mistakes in your text are easily rectified with the editing
facilities of the Organiser. To delete any character from
your text, use the chevron keys to position the cursor
under it and then press DELETE. If the cursor is
beyond the end of your line when you press DELETE,
the first character to its left is deleted, and the cursor
moves under the vacated position.

<p>If you suddenly find that the display does not change
when you try to enter something, you are probably
trying to exceed the limit of two hundred characters per
line. If necessary, edit your text to reduce its length.



</p><h3>Clearing The Display</h3>

<p>Pressing ON/CLEAR cancels the current entry and lets
you start again in the same activity. This is the key's
'CLEAR' function. For instance:

</p><div align="center"><p><img src="./Psion Organiser 1 Manual - Jaap&#39;s Psion Organiser II Page_files/c9l.gif" width="377" height="42" alt="ENTE[R:THE QUICK BRO]WN"></p></div>

<p>Only the activity indicator is retained, and you can now
enter something else or go on to another activity.
Pressing ON/CLEAR when the current line is empty
recalls the clock display, and the Organiser is reset as if
you had just switched on. You can always use this key to
clear the line and escape from whatever you are doing.

</p><hr>

<a name="c10"></a><h2>10<br>
'SAVE'</h2>

<p>Note. The 'SAVE' and 'FIND' sections assume that you
have a datapak in drive one only (which is how the
Organiser is supplied).

</p><p>Use the 'SAVE' activity to make a permanent copy of the
current line in the removable datapak. When you press
the SAVE key your Organiser will display the indicator
'SAVE1:' and the first nine characters of the current line.
Nothing is actually copied into a datapak until
EXECUTE is pressed, so press it when you are ready.
When you do this you will see the cursor move through
your text as the line is copied into the datapak. When
this process is completed, the activity indicator changes
from 'SAVE1:' to 'ENTER:'. Organiser automatically
selects 'ENTER', to prevent you accidentally saving the
same record twice. If you really want to return to 'SAVE',
press the SAVE key.

</p><p>To conserve space in your datapak, Organiser only
saves information which you have entered or edited, as
opposed to information it has produced itself. For
example the indicator 'SAVE1:' is not saved.

</p><p>Although 'SAVE' has full information editing facilities,
enabling you to type and edit information with 'SAVE'
selected, it is wise to do these things in 'ENTER' until
you are properly familiar with the Organiser. Remember,
every time you save an entry you are using storage
space in your datapak.

</p><p>Don't use 'SAVE' if the "LOW BATTERY" warning has
appeared. If you do, you may spoil the remaining space
in your datapak.

</p><div class="boxed"><div class="margin">
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p>To record information in a datapak:
Prepare the information in 'ENTER' or 'CALC'.
Press SAVE to select the 'SAVE' activity.
Press EXECUTE to make a record of your text in
a datapak.
</p></div></div>

<p>&nbsp;

</p><hr>

<a name="c11"></a><h2>11<br>
'FIND'</h2>

<p>The 'FIND' function is a powerful tool which searches
through your datapak for the information you wish to
recall. When you press the FIND key Organiser will
display 'FIND1:_'. Organiser now expects you to be
looking for a record you have already saved, and gives
you a clear line in which to enter the clue for the next
search. If you didn't clear the search clue last time you
used 'FIND', it is shown now, in case you want to use it
again or modify it.

</p><p>To search for a particular record, all you have to do is
give the organiser a search clue, that is a series of
characters that matches some part of the record you
want to retrieve. (For example, 'ANN' would be sufficient
to find a record of Joanna's name and telephone
number.) When you press EXECUTE, Organiser
searches for and displays the first record containing
exactly that series of characters. If this is not the record
you need, press EXECUTE to see the next one
containing the same series of characters.

</p><h3>Search Clues</h3>

<p>A search clue does not have to be a whole word and
can occur anywhere in the record. It may consist of
anything from one to fifteen characters, including
the spaces, but generally three or four characters will be
sufficient to find a record quickly.

</p><p>A more restricted search can be instituted by prefacing
your search clue with an asterisk. This tells the
Organiser that the search clue must occur at the
beginning of the record. For example, 'FIND1:*SUS'
would find the record 'SUSAN SMITH........' but not
'CONSENSUS........' whereas 'FIND1:SUS' would find
both.

</p><p>To broaden the search, do not enter a search clue at all.
With the display empty except for the activity indicator
FlND1:' press EXECUTE to see a copy of the next
record in the datapak. Press EXECUTE every time you
want to move on to the next record.

</p><p>If you ask your Organiser to find a series of characters
which does not occur in that datapak. the message
"NOT FOUND" will be shown. Press ON/CLEAR to
clear this message and recall the 'FlND1:' indicator and
your original string of characters. Check your search
clue carefully and modify it if necessary Press
EXECUTE to repeat the search.

</p><h3>Scanning A Found Record</h3>

<p>When a record is displayed, you can scan it from left to
right at a comfortable reading pace by pressing &gt;&gt;.
The record loops round to the beginning when it
reaches the end, so that you see a continuous
progression of its contents. To hold any part of the text in
the window, press &lt;&lt; once. and if you want it to move
backwards press &lt;&lt; again. In that case you press &gt;&gt;
to freeze the display.

</p><h3>Editing A Found Record</h3>

<p>The line of information which Organiser displays when it
has found a record is a copy of the original stored in the
datapak. Thus you can edit it, calculate and manipulate
it as you please without affecting the original.
Immediately you attempt to edit a found record. the
Organiser selects 'ENTER' and you can edit in the usual
way. To clear a displayed record (and go into 'ENTER')
press ON/CLEAR.

</p><h3>Erasing A Record</h3>

<p>Erasing a record from your datapak is like crossing out a
piece of written work. It is still there. occupying space,
but you can no longer read it.
ERASE' only becomes available when the Organiser is
displaying a retrieved record in 'FIND'. Press MODE
until 'ERASE:' appears to the left of the text. Now press
EXECUTE to erase the record. The text is cleared from
the display and the Organiser automatically presents
'ENTER'.
<br>The record can never be found again.

</p><h3>Updating Records</h3>

<p>If you wish to update a record. for example to alter train
times when the service is revised, you must find and
erase the old record and save a new one. Alternatively, if
a large part of the old record is still valid, you can find
edit it, save the new version. then find the old one
and erase it. Either way, as far as your Organiser
is concerned, the old record no longer exists.

</p><div class="boxed"><div class="margin">

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p>Pressing FIND prepares Organiser to find a
record in the datapak.
<br>Enter nothing for a general search, or up to fifteen
characters to identify a specific record.

<a name="c12"></a><h2>12<br>
'CALC'</h2>

<p>'CALC' is for arithmetical calculations. When you select
'CALC' Organiser automatically behaves as if you had
pressed SHIFT and the cursor flashes to indicate that
the keyboard will respond according to the yellow
numbers and symbols. (You can return to the alphabet
by pressing the SHIFT key, but Organiser will not
perform calculations on letters.)

</p><h3>To Carry Out A Calculation</h3>

<p>Select 'CALC': type your calculation, leaving no spaces
between characters. and press EXECUTE.

</p><p>Provided that your calculation contains no errors, the
Organiser immediately displays the result, which
consists of an equals sign and the answer. The last few
characters of your entry will also be displayed. Use the
chevron keys to see the rest of the line.

</p><p>If the Organiser finds any errors in your entry it will move
the cursor to the first character it does not understand.
and wait for you to correct it. (Some possible errors are:
an unpaired bracket, a letter of the alphabet, a space, a
number containing more than seven digits, or an in-
correct operation such as division by zero.) When you
have made the correction, press EXECUTE to try the
calculation again. Every time you press EXECUTE the
cursor will go to the next error, until you have corrected
them all.

</p><p>The exciting feature of the Organisers calculation facility
is that you can see the whole calculation, and can edit
any part of it as you wish, (Very important when your
calculation can be two hundred characters long.)
Before examining this in detail, a word about numbers
and symbols.

</p><h3>Numbers</h3>

<p>Your Organiser can deal with numbers containing up to
seven digits. You may enter numbers less than one as
decimals (with or without a nought before the point) or
as fractions. For example 0.25, .25 or 1/4. To make a
number negative, simply enter a minus sign before it.
Your Organiser can distinguish between this use of a
minus sign and its use in subtraction.

</p><p>The Organiser recognises and uses exponential format.
This is a neat way of presenting very large or small
numbers which would otherwise use too many digits.
and is explained below.

</p><h3>Recognising The Symbols</h3>

<p>You will find all the arithmetical symbols marked in
yellow under some of the character keys. Those you
may not recognise are:

</p><p>/ which means 'divide by'
<br>* which means 'multiply by'
<br>EE which means 'multiply by ten raised to the power
given by the next number'. Press this key when
entering a number in exponential format. (Only one
'E' is shown in the display)

</p><p>You can also use these symbols in general text.

</p><h3>Exponential Format</h3>

<p>A number which contains many noughts may be
conveniently written as a number between one and ten
multiplied by ten to a given power. For example, the
number 2 300 000 may be expressed as 2.3 times
1 000 000.

</p><p>Now 1 000 000 is ten raised to the sixth power: that is six
tens multiplied together. Therefore, we may sensibly
express the number 2 300 000 as 2.3 times ten to the
sixth power. Exponential format is a form of shorthand
which allows us to write this as 2.3 E 6. The E stands for
'multiplied by ten raised to the power given by the next
number' and the six means the sixth power. Negative
powers of ten are used with "E" in a similar way, so that
2.3 E-6 means 2.3 divided by ten to the sixth power:
that is 0.0000023. The smallest value your Organiser
can accept is 1.000000 E-99, and the largest is
9.999999 E99.

</p><p>Where it is appropriate, the Organiser presents the
results of calculations in exponential format.

</p><h3>Using Brackets</h3>

<p>Organiser allows you to use as many pairs of brackets
as you wish in your calculation, but only two levels of
brackets are allowed: i.e. you must not enclose more
than one pair of brackets within any other pair For
instance, 3*(1+2+3*(4+5*(7-6))) is unacceptable
because there are two pairs of brackets enclosed in
another pair, making three levels in all.

</p><p>Like other calculators, Organiser will normally carry out
any multiplication or division operations before addition
or subtraction. It you want it to carry out any additions or
subtractions first, you must enclose them in brackets.

</p><p>For example, the Organiser calculates 4*5+3 as 23. To
make it add the 5 and the 3 together before multiplying
by 4 you must enter 4*(5+3) which is calculated as 32.

</p><h3>Editing A Calculation</h3>

<p>Remember that a calculation can be edited just like any
other line of information, both before and after the result
is displayed. As well as making it easy to correct typing
mistakes, these facilities mean that you can perform a
whole series of calculations by editing the preceding
version, rather than re-typing it each time.

</p><p>This is useful for 'What if' analysis, where you want to
examine the effect of changing one parameter of a
system, e.g. the effect on profit of increased component
price.

</p><p>When you start editing a calculation the result
disappears because it is no longer valid.

</p><p>If you want to use the result of one calculation in the next
one, simply enter the additional numbers and symbols
to form the new calculation, and press EXECUTE for
the answer. Organiser assists you by deleting the equals
sign and everything to the left of it as soon as you start
editing the original result.

</p><p>The answer produced by the Organiser does not form
part of the current line so if, for instance, you press
SAVE, your calculation will be retained (as you typed it)
but the answer (which the Organiser supplied) will not.
However, if you edit the answer it becomes the current
line and can thus be saved and generally manipulated
in the normal way.

</p><div class="boxed"><div class="margin">

NOTES ABOUT DATAPAKS</h2>

<h3>Drives</h3>

<p>There are two solid-state drives for datapaks in the back
of your Organiser. (See Figure 1.1 and 1.2) When you
first purchase your Organiser, drive number one
contains a real datapak. A dummy datapak is fitted in
drive number two to protect the electrical connectors.
For the same reason you should always keep a real or
dummy datapak (or a program pack) in each drive.

</p><h3>Changing A Datapak</h3>

<p>Always switch off your Organiser before you remove or
fit a datapak.

</p><p>The datapaks slide into and out of their drives, and have
an easy-grip outer surface. Take care not to press the
ON/CLEAR key when removing or fitting a datapak.
(This is easily avoided by laying the machine face down
on a flat surface since the keyboard is slightly
recessed.) Simply press down and out on the ribbed
portion of the datapak to slide it out of its drive. To fit a
datapak, push it unto the required drive until you feel it
click home.

</p><p>Use the white label on your datapak to mark it for
identification later.

</p><h3>Two Datapaks</h3>

<p>The 'SAVE' and 'FIND' activities can be directed at either
of the datapak drives, and the number of the target drive
is shown in the activity indicator, i.e. 'FIND1:', 'FIND2:'.
'SAVE1:' and 'SAVE2'. To move from 'FIND1:' to 'FlND2:'
press the FIND key again. If you press FIND repeatedly,
Organiser selects datapak drives one and two
alternately. Similarly for 'SAVE'. Organiser checks which
datapak drives contain datapaks, and only offers
available options.

</p><p>Once you have used a particular drive, the Organiser
assumes you want to continue using the same one until
you select the other drive or switch off.

</p><h3>Re-Using A Datapak</h3>

<p>Although datapaks store your information permanently.
it is possible to clear an entire datapak using a special
process called formatting. This is achieved by
controlled exposure of the datapak to ultra-violet light in
a purpose-built machine, the Psion Formatter. The re-
formatted datapak will be completely blank and ready
for re-use. Note that the white label on the underside of
each datapak is to protect it from excessive exposure to
light and must be removed before formatting can occur.

</p><h3>Copying Between Datapaks</h3>

<p>You may wish to copy a record from one datapak into
another. Perhaps you are passing on an address to a
friend, reorganising your data storage, or preparing to
re-use a datapak.
<br>To copy a record, fit the two datapaks, find the record in
one and save it into the other. For example, imagine you
have a record in the datapak in drive one, which you
want to copy into the datapak in drive two. Press FIND
to make 'FIND1:' appear. Now find your record in the
normal way. When it is displayed, press SAVE until
'SAVE2:' appears to the left of your record. Press
EXECUTE to save the record in the datapak in drive
two. The copying process is now complete. You will be
able to do this with all your records except those which
you have erased.

</p><p>You may wish to transfer your records from the original
datapak into a new one of equal or greater storage
capacity. If your original datapak contains any erased
records, you will save space by this process, because
erased records will not be transferred.

</p><p>If you want to copy all the records in one datapak into
another, set the Organiser to 'FlND1:' and 'SAVE2:' or
vice-versa before you start, so that it automatically
chooses the correct datapak each time you find or
save a record.

</p><p>For example, to copy all the records from the datapak in
drive one to the datapak in drive two, press FIND until
'FlND1:' appears, then SAVE until 'SAVE2:' appears.
Now: press FIND, EXECUTE, SAVE, EXECUTE and
repeat this sequence until you return to the first record.
(Remember to note the first record you copy.)

</p><h3>"DATAPAK FULL"</h3>

<p>When a datapak is too full to accept the text you are
trying to save, Organiser displays the message
"DATAPAK FULL". To make any more records you need
another datapak. Your Organiser is originally fitted with
an eight kilobyte (8K) datapak, which can hold 10900
characters, but you can buy datapaks with greater
storage capacity.


</p><h3>"DATAPAK ERROR"</h3>

<p>This message means the Organiser is having difficulty
accessing the datapak. You should not see it unless
your datapak has suffered physical damage. The only
likely exception is if you have tried to save after receiving
the "BATTERY LOW" message, in which case you will
be able to find the existing records. but no more can be
saved on this datapak. It is advisable to transfer the
records into another datapak. The corrupted datapak
can then be reclaimed in a Psion Formatter.

</p><p>Pressing ON/CLEAR clears such error messages so
that you can continue.

</p><hr>

<a name="c14"></a><h2>14<br>
HINTS ABOUT RECORDS</h2>

<p>When you are entering information you want to save
think about finding it and structure it to give maximum
retrieval efficiency. Points to remember:

</p><ul>
<li>Include the word that you will most likely want to use
as a search clue. (For instance, if you record the
name and phone number of a good local plumber
include the word plumber' so you can find his
phone number when you need him, although you've
forgotten his name.)<br>&nbsp;

</li><li>When a record is recalled, you see its first sixteen
characters immediately, and because you can scan
it backwards, its last few characters are instantly
accessible too. Use both groups for the information
you will need most often, remembering that you
need to know quickly which record you have found.
(For instance, if you are looking up your personal
classification of all the hotels you know in a certain
town, you will probably want to see your comment
immediately, and if that is favourable flick back to
see the phone number.)<br>&nbsp;

</li><li>If you want to categorise several records, which do
not share an obvious search clue so that you can
retrieve as a list preface each one with the
same unusual character series. (For instance, when
you are entering records of things you must do this
month, you could start them all with QDO.)<br>&nbsp;

</li><li>The answer to a calculation can only be saved if you
edit it. You could usefully do this by adding a label, to
give it a meaningful identity. For example supposing
you have calculated the floor area, in square yards,
of a kitchen which measures 15 feet by 12 feet, and
'CALC:15*12/9=20' is displayed. You might, for
instance, edit the result to add the label 'KITCHEN
FLOOR' at the beginning and 'SQ YDS', or whatever
abbreviation you prefer, at the end.

<p>Now you can save the information and be able to
find it easily when you need it. If you had several
records of floor area you could enter 'FLOOR' or 'SQ'
or 'YDS' as a search clue to find them all in quick
succession. To find the kitchen area in particular, it
would be quicker to search for '*KITCH'.
