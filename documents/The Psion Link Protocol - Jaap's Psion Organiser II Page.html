<h1>The Psion Link Protocol</h1>

<hr>

<p>In this document I've tried to document in detail the way the Psion
protocol works on the comms link of the Psion II Organiser. The information
given here is the result of reverse engineering, so may be incomplete and not
entirely correct, so if you find any thing that needs to be changed or added,
let me know. All numbers are in hexadecimal unless stated otherwise.

<a id="linklayer"></a><h2>1. The Link Layer</h2>

<p>In its simplest form data is sent over the link using the 'link layer', an
error correcting protocol which uses data packets.
Each packet has the following format (in hex):

  16 10 02 CHAN TYPE DATA 10 03 CRC.

</p><p>The first three bytes are always 16 10 02.

</p><p>The next byte, CHAN, is the channel number (?). It must always equal 01.
It is compared to the value stored at $2173, which is set to 01 when the
comms link is loaded and not changed afterwards. It may be that some
other communications devices use a different channel number.

</p><p>The next byte, TYPE, contains the type of packet in the top 5 bits, and
also a sequence number in the bottom 3 bits. The sequence number is a
number that each data packet has to make sure that they are not mixed up.
Since the sequence number increases with each new data packet, missing
packets can be detected.

</p><p>There are 4 types of packet:
</p><table border="0" summary="">
  <tbody><tr><td valign="top">type=0:</td><td>ACKNOWLEDGE. Signals proper reception of a data packet. The
            sequence number of the acknowledge is the same as that of the
            data packet received. If a packet is received with the wrong
            sequence number, an acknowledge is sent of the last correct
            data packet, so this is also used as a request for the next
            packet. Contains no data.</td></tr>
  <tr><td valign="top">type=1:</td><td>DISCONNECT. Signal that communication is to end. When sent to
            the Psion, the data should contain the error number. If the
            Psion sends one then it has no data. The sequence number is 0.</td></tr>
  <tr><td valign="top">type=2:</td><td>LINK REQUEST. Requests a connection. Used at the start of a
            session to test two-way communication. Sequence number is 0 and
            it contains no data.</td></tr>
  <tr><td valign="top">type=3:</td><td>DATA. A data packet. The sequence number is one more than that
            of the previous data packet (modulo 8) or 1 if it is the first
            data packet of the session.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Since there are only  4 types, only bits 3 and 4 of the TYPE byte are
used to store the packet type and bits 0, 1 and 2 will always be zero.

</p><p>The bytes 10 03 follow the data to signal the end of the packet.

</p><p>The CRC is a 16-bit checksum for all the bytes between the header 16 10 02
and the footer 10 03. See below.

</p><p>To make sure that sending the bytes 10 03 in the data will not prematurely
end the packet, an escape mechanism is used. Every 10 byte in the data (or
chan/type bytes) will be sent twice over the link. The receiving end then
replaces each 10 10 by a single 10, and will not end the packet if it is
followed by a 03. The extra 10 is not used in generating the CRC however.

</p><p>The maximum length of the data is 0100h bytes. Repeated 10 bytes are not
included in this count.

</p><p>The 16-bit CRC checksum used by the Psion protocol is the CCITT checksum
(GenCRC) with generating polynomial x^16+x^12+x^5+1 (i.e. 10241h). It can
be computed by knowing the following values:
<br>CRC(01)=C1C0
<br>CRC(02)=81C1
<br>CRC(04)=01C3
<br>CRC(08)=01C6
<br>CRC(10)=01CC
<br>CRC(20)=01D8
<br>CRC(40)=01F0
<br>CRC(80)=01A0

</p><p>The CRC of any single byte can be computed by EOR-ing (exclusive OR) the
values above together for each set bit in the byte. It is probably faster to
pre-calculate an array for all byte values first.
To get the CRC of a sequence of bytes, it can be done iteratively, by starting
with the CRC of the first byte, and adjusting it each time the next byte is
included. If xxyy is the CRC for a sequence of one or more bytes, then the CRC
of that sequence followed by a byte bb will be CRC(bb eor xx) eor (yy00).

</p><p>For example, let's calculate CRC(01 10):

</p><table summary="0" border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>CRC(01) </td><td>= C1C0</td></tr>
<tr><td>CRC(01 10) </td><td>= CRC(10 eor C1) eor C000</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= CRC(D1) eor C000</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= CRC(80) eor CRC(40) eor CRC(10) eor CRC(01) eor C000</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= 01A0 eor 01F0 eor 01CC eor C1C0 eor C000</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= 005C</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<a id="linkproto"></a><h2>2. The Link Protocol</h2>


<a id="startup"></a><h3>2a. The start-up sequence</h3>

<p>When CL is running on the PC, it continuously sends out Link Request
packets. When the Psion is ready to start communicating it first starts
up a link session in the following manner:
</p><ol type="1">
<li>The Psion waits to receive a Link Request. It times out if none are received.
</li><li>It sends a Link Request in reply.
</li><li>It waits to receive an Acknowledgment (seq.nr. 0). It times out if none.
</li></ol>
<p>After that the link is considered to be active and working, and the sequence
numbers are reset to 1.

</p><p>Specifically, the packets involved are:</p>

<table summary="0" border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>Receive Link Request:</td><td>16 10 02 01 10 10 10 03 00 5C</td></tr>
<tr><td>Send Link Request:</td><td>16 10 02 01 10 10 10 03 00 5C</td></tr>
<tr><td>Recieve Acknowledgement: </td><td>16 10 02 01 00 10 03 01 90</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>If in step 3 a disconnect request is received, it should contain an error
byte as data. Receiving a data packet will cause the Psion to return a
data acknowledgement, and then it also considers the link to be active.

</p><p>The start-up sequence above is performed before every data transfer. It can
also be called specifically by using the XLCON: command, or calling rs$licon
in machine code.


<a id="sending"></a></p><h3>2b. Sending data from the Psion</h3>

<p>When sending a sequence of data packets, each packet is numbered
1,2,..,6,7,0,1,... etc. After each packet is sent, a reply is expected.
What happens next depends on the type of reply:
</p><ul>
  <li>An acknowledgement with the correct sequence number:
    <br>The packet has been successfully sent, so now further packets can be
    sent if necessary.
  </li><li>An acknowledgement with the wrong sequence number, or
  </li><li>A packet with an incorrect CRC, or
  </li><li>A data packet:
    <br>The same data packet will be re-sent. If this happens too often, a 'Device Read' error occurs.
  </li><li>A link request:
    <br>A 'Device read' error occurs.
  </li><li>A disconnect packet:
    <br>The error in the packet is raised.
</li></ul>

<p>A single packet can be sent using the XLPUT:(a$) command, or rs$liput in
machine code.


<a id="receiving"></a></p><h3>2c. Receiving data on the Psion</h3>

<p>
When receiving a sequence of data packets, each packet should numbered
1,2,..,6,7,0,1,... etc. After each packet is received, a reply is expected.
When the Psion is waiting for a data packet, what happens depends on the
type of packet it receives:
</p><ul>
  <li>A data packet with the correct sequence number:
    <br>An acknowledgement is sent for this packet. The data is stored.
  </li><li>A data packet with the wrong sequence number, or
  </li><li>A packet with an incorrect CRC, or too long:
    <br>An acknowledgement is sent with the previous sequence number, i.e. the sequence number of the last received packet.
  </li><li>A link request, or
  </li><li>A disconnect packet:
    <br>The error in the packet is raised.
  </li><li>An acknowledgement:
    <br>It is simply ignored.
</li></ul>

<p>A single packet can be received using the XLGET$: command, or rs$liput in
machine code.

</p><p>Note that the sequence numbers used when receiving packets are independent
from those used when sending packets.


<a id="disconnecting"></a></p><h3>2d. Disconnecting</h3>

<p>When the link session is finished, the link should be deactivated. This is
done by calling the XLDIS: command, or rs$lidis in machine code. This will
send a disconnect packet, and close the link session. The disconnect packet
has no data when sent from the Psion, but those sent by CL will contain a
single byte which is the error number.



<a id="higher"></a></p><h2>3. Higher layers</h2>

<p>The link layer is simply an error correcting protocol for sending small
snippets of data. Built on top of this is a protocol for sending and
receiving files, file access commands etc.

</p><p>The Psion Series 3 and 5 first have an NCP protocol layer above the link
layer. NCP is a method of sending data over different channels. This is
not implemented on the series II, though there seems to be a simple
channel byte in every packet which is not used at all.

</p><p>The file protocol layer generally works like this:
</p><ol type="1">
  <li>The start-up sequence is performed first.
  </li><li>The Psion sends a word like 'FTRAN' in a data packet (which is
      acknowledged in the link layer as usual).
  </li><li>The CL program loads the FTRAN overlay, the program in S_FTRAN.EXE
  </li><li>The PC sends back an empty data packet as reply (which is again
      acknowledged in the link layer as usual).
  </li><li>The Psion sends a command to the FTRAN program in a data packet (+ack).
  </li><li>The PC sends data packet back in reply (+ack).
  </li><li>Repeat 5 and 6 till everything accomplished.
  </li><li>The Psion sends a disconnect packet, and CL removes its overlay.
</li></ol>


<p>If CL encounters an error, it sends a disconnect packet containing the
error number to be raised. The new error numbers are:
<br>190  Bad parameter
<br>189  Remote file not found
<br>188  Server error
<br>187  Remote file exists
<br>186  Disk full
<br>185  Record too long

</p><p>It now remains to be explained what overlays there are, what commands they
accept and what data they return.



<a id="file"></a></p><h3>3a. The FILE overlay</h3>

<p>This overlay handles all remote file access (i.e. XFOPEN, XFCLOSE etc).
There are five types of data packet that the Psion sends to CL/FILE. The
data packet starts with a byte between 00 and 04 to indicate its type:

</p><table summary="0" border="0">
<tbody><tr><td valign="top">XFOPEN: </td><td valign="top">00&nbsp;mode&nbsp;type&nbsp;name</td><td valign="top">
                  Opens a remote file where mode/type are bytes and name is a
                  string, exactly the same parameters as the XFOPEN command.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">XFCLOSE:</td><td valign="top">01</td><td valign="top">
                  Closes current remote file if any.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">XFPUT:  </td><td valign="top">02&nbsp;datastring</td><td valign="top">
                  Puts the data at the current file position.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">XFGET$: </td><td valign="top">03&nbsp;length</td><td valign="top">
                  Gets (at most) length bytes from the current file position
                  which are returned in the reply data packet from CL/FILE.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">XFPOS:  </td><td valign="top">04&nbsp;mode&nbsp;position</td><td valign="top">
                  Changes the current file position. Mode is a byte but position
                  is a string representation of the file position. The
                  reply data packet contains a string representation of the
                  new file position.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The file types used in XFOPEN are:
</p><table summary="0" border="0">
<tbody><tr><td valign="top">00</td><td valign="top">Binary</td><td valign="top">A random access binary file.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">01</td><td valign="top">Ascii</td><td valign="top">An sequential ascii file. Any data sent by XFPUT will be appended
                   to the file, and automatically terminated by a CR/LF linebreak even
                   though this is not sent.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">02</td><td valign="top">Directory</td><td valign="top">A directory file. This is a read-only sequential ascii file,
                   containing all the file names matching the dos pathname given
                   (which may contain wild cards * and +).</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The file modes used in XFOPEN are:
</p><table summary="0" border="0">
<tbody><tr><td valign="top">00</td><td valign="top">Read only</td><td valign="top">An existing file is opened for reading. An error 189 (remote
                        file not found) is sent if it does not exist.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">01</td><td valign="top">Create/Replace</td><td valign="top">Any existing file of the same name is removed, and a new file
                        is opened for writing.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">02</td><td valign="top">Replace</td><td valign="top">An existing file is opened and cleared for writing. An error
                        189 (remote file not found) is sent if it does not exist.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">03</td><td valign="top">Create</td><td valign="top">An new file is opened for writing. An error 187 (remote file
                        exists) is sent if it already exists.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">04</td><td valign="top">Update</td><td valign="top">An existing file is opened for writing (appending if ascii),
                        but not cleared.  An 189 (remote file not found) if it does
                        not exist.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Note that the initial file position is always at the beginning of the file, except
for sequential ascii files in Update mode which are opened at the end of the file
so that any new data is appended.

</p><p>Using an illegal filemode or filetype will return an error 190 (bad parameter).
Using XFPUT in read-only mode (00) will return an error 188 (server error).
Using XFPOS on a non-binary file will return an error.
Opening a directory file in any mode other than read-only will return an
error.


</p><p>For example, suppose we run the following short program:
</p><p class="program">TEST:
XFOPEN:("HOMER.TXT",1,1)
XFPUT$:("Doh"+CHR$(33))
XFCLOSE:</p>

<p>then the following list is the complete exchange between the Psion and the
PC, assuming no errors occur and no packets are re-sent:

<a id="ftran"></a></p><h3>3b. The FTRAN overlay</h3>

<p>This is the most commonly used one. It handles all standard file transfer.
There are four types of data packet that the Psion sends to FTRAN. The
data packet starts with a byte between 00 and 03 to indicate its type:

</p><table summary="0" border="0">
<tbody><tr><td valign="top">Open:     </td><td valign="top">00&nbsp;mode&nbsp;filetype&nbsp;filename</td><td valign="top">
                  Tells FTRAN to open a remote file. Note that the mode
                  is similar to those used by the FILE overlay. The
                  filetype is 00 for ODB files, 01 for OPL files, 02-0F
                  for block files.</td></tr>

<p>The file modes are the same as with the FILE overlay, except that modes 02
and 03 are not allowed:
</p><table summary="0" border="0">

                        is sent if it does not exist.</td></tr>

                        it does not exist. Note that this file mode is
                        generally only used to test whether a file exists, not
                        for writing/appending to a file.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Using an illegal filemode (incl. 02 or 03) or filetype will return an error 190
(bad parameter). Sending data in reading mode (00), or requesting data in write
mode (01-04) will return an 190 (Bad Parameter) error.

</p><p>When a file is opened for reading (mode 00) then FTRAN often returns info
about the file so that the Psion can prepare memory space for it.

</p><p>When sending/receiving ODB files, each record is sent in a seperate packet.
No info is returned after an ODB file is opened for reading.

</p><p>When sending/receiving block files, the data is split into seperate packets,
generally about FE bytes long. The info returned when opening the file for
reading is the length of the block in the file, followed by the Psion file
type (between 82 and 8F).

</p><p>When sending/receiving OPL files, the data is split into seperate packets
just like block files. The line ends are indicated by a zero byte, and it
is FTRAN that translates them to/from CR/LF when writing to disk.
The info returned after the recv command is as follows:
<br>   blocklength, 81h, 0000, OPLlength
<br>OPLlength is the total length of the OPL in bytes when all CR/LF linebreaks
are changed to a zero byte. Note that the final line of OPL must also end in
00 even if the ascii file does not end in a CR/LF.
The blocklength always equals 4+OPLlength.
When the procedure file is constructed on a pack, the length is blocklength
given above. The organiser then writes 0000, OPLlength. This signifies that
the length of the object code block is 0, and that the OPL part has length
OPLlength. If these lengths are incorrect, the pack will be corrupted.



<a id="boot"></a></p><h3>3c. The BOOT overlay</h3>

<p>This overlay handles the loading of BOOT code, and the XMLOAD: command.
After the BOOT overlay is loaded, it expects to be sent a data packet
containing the name of the boot file to load. The reply packet contains
the length of the code.

</p><p>The Psion then sends a packet containing the address to load the code.
In reply the first data packet contains the first part of the code, ready
to be stored in memory. When the Psion next sends a packet containing just
a zero byte, the next code packet is sent. This is repeated as often as
necessary.

</p><p>When the end of the code has been reached, a disconnect packet with a
zero error is returned by CL/BOOT.

</p><p>Note that fixing up the relocatable addresses in the code is done by CL/BOOT.

</p><p>Instead of using the BOOT option in the menu, the XMLOAD: command can be
used. XMLOAD:(addr%,len%,name$) loads the boot code from remote file name$
to address addr%, but rejects it if the code exceeds length len%.



<a id="exit"></a></p><h3>3d. The EXIT overlay</h3>

<p>This overlay exits the CL program completely (by stuffing q and y in the
keyboard buffer of the PC). It has no other functions. It can therefore
be used by using the following sequence of commands:
</p><p class="program">XLCON:
XLPUT:("EXIT")
XLDIS:</p>



<a id="plan"></a><h3>3e. The PLAN and PLANM overlays</h3>

<p>These overlays are used by the spreadsheet program. When you choose the
FILE/IMPORT or FILE/EXPORT menu options, the Psion requests the PLANM
overlay which returns the file type menu, and the Psion disconnects again.
The file type menu returned is 19h bytes long and is as follows:
</p><p class="program">03 "WKS" 0001
03 "WK1" 0002
03 "WR1" 0003
03 "DIF" 0004
00</p>
<p>It is in the correct format for the MN$DISP (SWI 50h) system service.

</p><p>The PLAN overlay handles the transfer and conversion of the spreadsheet
files. To export a file, the Psion first sends it a packet of which the
first byte is between 81h and 84h depending on the file type chosen, and
the rest contains the file name. The spreadsheet data follows; first a
packet containing the dimensions of the sheet, then a packet for each
non-empty cell, and finally a packet containing just FE. The reply that
PLAN gives each time is a packet containing 00, except that the FE is
answered with FE 00.

</p><p>A cell is stored in this format:
</p><table summary="0" border="0">
<tbody><tr><td valign="top">Column:</td><td valign="top">Byte containing column of cell (0 is column A)</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Row:   </td><td valign="top">Byte containing row of cell (0 is row 1)</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Type:  </td><td valign="top">Contains 22h (=") if cell contains text<br>
            Contains 87h if cell contains a number or formula</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Contents: </td><td valign="top">Ascii string with contents of cell.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>If a cell contains a formula and its result then one packet contains the
formula, and the cell is resent in the next packet but this time containing
just the value.
For example, here are the packets sent to PLAN to export a simple sheet (only the packet data is shown):
</p><table summary="0" border="0">
<tbody><tr><td valign="top"><span class="code">84 54 45 53 54             </span></td><td valign="top">Export TEST in DIF format.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><span class="code">02 04                      </span></td><td valign="top">Columns A-B, Rows 1-4 used.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><span class="code">01 00 22 43 4F 4C 31       </span></td><td valign="top">B1, contains "COL1"</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><span class="code">00 01 22 52 4F 57 31       </span></td><td valign="top">A2, contains "ROW1"</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><span class="code">01 01 87 31                </span></td><td valign="top">B2, contains 1</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><span class="code">00 02 22 52 4F 57 32       </span></td><td valign="top">A3, contains "ROW2"</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><span class="code">01 02 87 35                </span></td><td valign="top">B3, contains 5</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><span class="code">01 03 87 3D 42 32 2B 42 33 </span></td><td valign="top">B4, contains =B2+B3 (formula)</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><span class="code">01 03 87 36                </span></td><td valign="top">B4, contains 6 (value)</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><span class="code">FE                         </span></td><td valign="top">End of sheet</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Import is very similar. First the Psion sends CL/PLAN a packet of which the
first byte is between 01 and 04 depending on the file type chosen, and
the rest contains the file name. It just returns 00. Then the Psion sends
a 00 and PLAN returns the first non-empty cell, in the same format as
before. This is repeated until PLAN sends FE00, signifying the end of the
sheet.
