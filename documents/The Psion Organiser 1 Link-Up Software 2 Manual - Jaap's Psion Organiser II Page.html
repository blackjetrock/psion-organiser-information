<a name="c1"></a><h2>1<br>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>
With the Link-Up Software Pack 2 you can use your
Organiser
</p>

<ul>
<li>as a terminal to a mainframe or minicomputer
</li><li>to access electronic mail or billboard systems via a modem
</li><li>to transfer files to and from other microcomputers
</li><li>to print records from a datapak
</li></ul>

<p>
The Link-Up Software Pack 2 contains programs
which enable your Organiser to communicate with a
range of RS232 and RS423 compatible equipment.
Once these programs have been loaded the software
pack does not have to be in the Organiser for data
communication to take place.
</p>

<p>
To use Link-Up, you need to purchase two packs from
the Psion range of communication products. You
need:
</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>A software pack.
  <br><b>Either</b> the Link-Up Software Pack 2 (this pack)
  <br><b>or</b> the Link-Up Software Pack 1
</li><li>The Psion Link-Up Cable
</li></ol>

<p>You may also need a Link-Up Adaptor between the
Link-Up Cable and you particular equipment.
</p>

<h3>The Link-Up Cable</h3>

<p>
The Psion Link-Up Cable has been designed to fit into
the "solid state drives" of the Organiser. The Link-Up
Cable looks like a datapak attached to a multi-
coloured ribbon cable, ending in a special 25-pin
socket. As you would expect, it is used to connect the
Organiser to other equipment which will be referred to
as the "target". This cable must be plugged into the
Organiser whenever data transfer takes place.
</p>

<p>
If the pin layout used by your target machine is not the
same as the pin layout on the Link-Up Cable you will
need an adaptor. The pin layout of the Psion Link-Up
Cable is described in detail in Appendix A.
</p>

<h3>The adaptors</h3>

<p>
The Link-Up Cable will connect directly with the serial
interface of an IBM PC. If you want to communicate
with equipment which does not use exactly the same
pin layout as the IBM PC serial interface. you will need
an adaptor. A selection of adaptors is available, either
from your Psion Organiser dealer, or direct from Psion
Limited.
</p>

<p>
If the adaptor you need is not available, either you or
your dealer may be able to make one, Before
attempting to  make your own please consult
Appendix A.
</p>

<h3>The Psion Link-Up Software
<br>Packs 1 and 2</h3>

<p>
Software Pack 1 is designed to allow your Organiser
to send and receive either single lines of information
or whole files. If your only need is to transfer files
between your Organiser and a printer or a
microcomputer, Link-Up Software Pack 1 should fulfill
all your requirements.
</p>

<p>
Software Pack 2 is designed to be used with the
Organiser as a terminal to a larger computer system.
It also enables you to store full 8-bit data in a datapak.
Amongst other benefits, this allows you to send and
receive both UPPER and lower case letters and an
extended range of characters (for example, the £ and
# signs).
</p>

<h3>How to make connection</h3>

<p>
You may wish to use Link-Up to communicate with a
mainframe computer, a minicomputer, a
microcomputer or a printer. For simplicity the
machine you wish to communicate with will be called
the <b>target</b>.
</p>

<p>
Before communication can take place:
</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>You must load the communications software
   from the Link-Up Software Pack and use the
   <b>SETUP</b> command. Chapter Three describes
   what this command does. When you have used
   <b>SETUP</b> you can remove the software pack
   from the Organiser.
   <br>You may have to run a similar program
   on your target machine to perform the same
   function as the <b>SETUP</b> command on the
   Organiser.
</li><li>You must connect the Organiser to your target
   machine with the Link-Up Cable and
   appropriate adaptors. Switch the Organiser off
   before inserting the cable into the Organiser.
</li></ol>

<p>
After these operations have been performed, you are
ready to send and receive data. Chapter Four shows
you how to use the Organiser in TERMINAL mode.
</p>

<p>
Chapter Five is devoted to a set of examples, showing
all these stages in detail.
</p>

<p>
When you first use Link-Up, it can take some time to
match the communication needs of your target
machine to those of the Organiser. The Link-Up
software is designed to let you store the settings you
need so that they can be automatically loaded the
next time you want communication to take place.
</p>

<hr>

<a name="c2"></a><h2>2<br>Loading the<br>Communications Software</h2>

<p>
With the Organiser switched off, fit your Link-Up
Software Pack into either of the solid state drives in the
back of your Organiser. You should not have any other
program pack (such as the Finance pack) in your
Organiser at the same time.
</p>

<p>
Switch on the Organiser. You can test to see that the
software has been loaded by pressing the
<b>MODE/HOME</b> key repeatedly. The commands
available should be:
</p>

<p class="indent"><b>ENTER
<br>OFF
<br>SETUP
<br>RESET</b></p>

<p>
Every time you turn on the Organiser with a Link-Up
Software pack in place these commands will be
available. Note that the <b>CALC</b> option is not available
when using Link-Up.
</p>

<h3>SETUP</h3>

<p>
<b>SETUP</b> and <b>RESET</b> can only be executed when a
Link-Up Software pack is in place. <b>SETUP</b> is
described in detail in the next chapter.
</p>

<p>
<b>Once the SETUP command has been used, turning
the Organiser off does not delete the
communications software. The Organiser can be
turned off and the Software pack removed without
affecting the communications software.</b>
</p>

<h3>RESET</h3>

<p>
<b>RESET</b> clears the communications software from the
organiser and returns it to its normal state. Select
<b>RESET</b>, press <b>EXECUTE</b>, and the normal Organiser
functions, including <b>CALC</b>, will return.
</p>

<p>
Removing the battery or using any other specialist
program pack (such as the Psion Finance pack) also
clears the communication software. You should press
the <b>ON/CLEAR</b> key several times and wait a couple of
minutes before reconnecting the battery after
removing it.
</p>

<p>
When the communications software has been
cleared, you must reload it before any further
communications can be undertaken.
</p>

<hr>

<a name="c3"></a><h2>3<br>The SETUP command</h2>

<p>
Imagine you are tuning in your radio. The station you
want is transmitting at a certain frequency in a certain
waveband. In order to hear it you must do two things.
You must find out what the transmitted frequency is,
then you must tune your radio to that frequency.
Similarly, before communication can take place
between the Organiser and a target device you must
find out various things about the way in which the two
machines can transfer data, then use the <b>SETUP</b>
command to tell the Organiser what they are.
</p>

<p>
Setting up communication between the Organiser
and a target machine is more complicated than
tuning in a radio receiver. There are several settings to
make, rather than just one.
</p>

<p>
Both the Organiser and the target machine must be
set to transfer information at the same speed (or Baud
rate). Because information can be sent both ways
between Organiser and target, you must also set the
controls which determine when data will be
transmitted (known as handshaking). Also, since
different machines transmit data in different ways you
must set the pattern of bits sent in each group of
information. Because you usually are in control of
both ends of the communication, you must set all
these things on both the Organiser and the target
machine.
</p>

<p>
Collectively, the settings which must be agreed
between the Organiser and the target machine are
called <b>transmission parameters</b>. You must first
discover or set these transmission parameters on the
target machine, then use the <b>SETUP</b> command to tell
the Organiser what they are. A brief description of
each of these parameters is given later in this Chapter,
but it is not necessary to understand what each one
does in order to use Link-Up. It is important, however
to make sure that the settings are the same on both
machines. You may have to run communications
software on the target machine, but this will depend
on its nature.
</p>

<p>
If, for example, you intend to use the Organiser as a
terminal to a mainframe or minicomputer, or log into
an electronic mail or billboard system, it will already
be set up for communications. You will not have to
run a setup program on the target. All you have to do
is discover what transmission parameters the system
uses.
</p>

<p>
If your target is another computer, you will need to run
some sort of communications program on it to set
these parameters. On printers, these parameters are
often set on banks of switches. Chapter Five includes
examples of the whole procedure.
</p>

<p>
Once the parameters you need have been set on the
Organiser they can be saved on the Software pack so
that they are loaded automatically the next time the
communications software is loaded.
</p>

<h3>Using SETUP</h3>

<p>
To get into <b>SETUP</b> press the <b>MODE/HOME</b> key until
<b>SETUP</b> appears in the display, then press the
<b>EXECUTE</b> key. The Organiser searches the Software
pack for the last set of parameters saved. It loads
them into its memory, and displays the first of these -
TBAUD - on its screen.
</p>

<h3>The Transmission Parameters</h3>

<p>
Within <b>SETUP</b> the <b>FIND</b> and <b>SAVE</b> keys take on their
alternative meanings, becoming ↓ and ↑ respectively,
as indicated by the blue arrows below the keys. Use
these keys to move up and down through the list of
parameters and their current values. Figure 3.1 lists
the parameters you can set in this way, and the values
you can choose from in each case.
</p>

<p>
The parameters are, effectively, arranged in a loop.
For instance, you can move from TBAUD to CTRL
either by pressing ↑ twice or by pressing ↓ eleven
times. The values of most of the parameters are set by
a multiple choice system, where you use the &lt;&lt; and
&gt;&gt; keys to move left and right through a row of
options for that parameter until the one you want is
displayed. The value is now fixed until you alter it
again. For example. to change the handshaking from
RTS/CTS to XON/XOFF, press the ↓ key until
<b>HAND:RTS/CTS</b> appears on the screen. Then press
the &gt;&gt; key until the display shows
<b>HAND:XON/XOFF</b>. Note that you could also get from
RTS/CTS to XON/XOFF by pressing &lt;&lt; twice.
</p>

<p>
You can set the parameters in any order you choose.
When you wish to accept the setup as it stands move
to the <b>EXIT</b> command and press <b>EXECUTE</b>. Until
you do that, there is no limit to the number of times
you may alter the value of each parameter. When you
execute <b>EXIT</b> the parameter values set become
effective and remain so for all ensuing
communications, until you replace the setup with
another, or clear the communications software.

</p>
</div>

<h3>Transmission Parameters Defined</h3>
<h3>BAUD RATE - TBAUD AND RBAUD</h3>

<p>
The Baud rate measures the speed at which lines of
data are transferred. It is sometimes called bits per
second by other communications packages.
</p>

<p>
The TBAUD rate is the speed at which the Organiser
transmits data to the target. The RBAUD rate is the
speed at which the Organiser receives data.
</p>

<p>
It is not always best just to use the highest Baud rate
available. If the Baud rate is high, the probability of
transmission errors increases. If some of your
characters are not being transferred correctly, try
lowering the Baud rate on both Organiser and target.
</p>

<p>
Many printers print at a much slower speed than the
maximum Baud rate available with Link-Up. If you are
using Link-Up to connect to a printer, increasing the
Baud rate will probably not have any effect on the
speed at which printing takes place.
</p>

<h3>PARITY, DATA &amp; STOP BITS</h3>

<p>
The Organiser can transmit data in groups (known as
frames) of ten or eleven bits. One character of data is
included in each frame.
</p>

<p>
The first bit of each group is the start bit. The next
seven or eight bits contain the actual data. Then there
may be a bit known as the parity bit. Lastly, there will
be one or two step bits. The PARITY, BITS and STOP
commands allow you to specify the data frame you
need.
</p>

<p>
Figure 3.2 shows all the possible ways of combining
start, data, parity and stop bits in a frame of ten or
eleven bits. Simple addition will reveal that <b>two
combinations are not allowed</b>. Seven data, no parity
and one stop bit is an illegal combination. It would
leave only nine bits in the data frame. Similarly eight
data bits, two stop bits and a parity bit is an illegal
combination, because it would lead to a data frame of
twelve bits. Link-Up will not allow either of these
combinations to be set.

<small>Legal Data Frames Figure 3.2
</small></p>
</div>

<h3>PARITY - PAR</h3>

<p>
A parity bit is a bit added to the data frame by the
transmitting device. It helps the receiving device
check whether the data has arrived correctly. There
are several different types of parity checking in use.
The four most commonly used types, all recognised
and accepted by Link-Up are shown in figure 3.1.
</p>

<p>
If your target device uses parity checking, make sure
that your Organiser SETUP uses the same type of
parity checking as the target device. Select the
appropriate type using &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;.
</p>

<p>
If your target does not allow parity checking, select
parity <b>NONE</b> on your SETUP. If you do not use parity
checking, the parity bit is not included in the data
frame, allowing you to include one more data or stop
bit.
</p>

<h3>DATA BITS - BITS</h3>

<p>
This command allows you to set the number of data
bits, in each frame. As stated above, the length of
each frame may be ten or eleven bits. Of these only
seven or eight contain the information you want to
transfer. The others are the start bit, stop bit(s) and the
optional parity bit. With the &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; keys you may
set the number of data bits to be seven or eight.
</p>

<p>
Some manufacturers include the parity bit in their
definition of the data bits. This means that they would
call seven data bits and a parity bit eight data bits.
Check the definition of data bits used by your target
device in its documentation.
</p>

<p>
Seven bits of data (not including the parity bit) is the
most common number of bits used in data
communication. Some systems are set up to expect
eight bits per character, and to allow communication
with such devices the Link-Up Software Pack 2 will
accept, transmit and save data frames with eight data
bits.
</p>

<h3>STOP BITS - STOP</h3>

<p>
Stop bits mark the end of the data frame. Some
systems use one stop bit, others require two. Link-Up
allows you to choose either option using the &gt;&gt; and
&lt;&lt; keys. Remember, however, that the total number
of bits in a frame must be ten or eleven. The six
combinations of bits which satisfy all the conditions
are shown in figure 3.2
</p>

<h3>HANDSHAKING - HAND</h3>

<p>
Data can only be transmitted when one device is
ready to transmit and the other is ready to receive.
Handshaking is a technique which ensures that this
happens. It is another safety check on data transfer.
Three handshaking options are offered by the Link-
Up pack. They are <b>RTS/CTS</b>, <b>XON/XOFF</b> or <b>NONE</b>.
RTS/CTS is sometimes referred to as hardware
handshaking, and XON/XOFF is sometimes called
software handshaking.
</p>

<p>
If you are using the Organiser as a terminal to a
mainframe or with a modem to a remote system, you
will probably be using XON/XOFF handshaking.
</p>

<p>
If you are using Link-Up with a printer, or with certain
types of microcomputer you may wish to use RTS/CTS
handshaking. In this case, you must make sure that
the hardware handshaking lines on the Link-Up
Cable and adaptor you are using are correctly wired.
</p>

<p>
There is another form of hardware handshaking
called DSR/DTR Appendix A describes how Link-
Up's RTS/CTS handshaking can be used to
communicate with a DSR/DTR system.
</p>

<p>
If your target does not support any of the types of
handshaking mentioned, you will have to choose
<b>NONE</b>.
</p>

<h3>EXECUTE - EXE</h3>

<p>
On most computers, a line ends when you press the
return key. On some systems, pressing the return key
generates a carriage return character and a line feed
character. On other systems however, the return key
will only send a carriage return character.
</p>

<p>
On the Organiser, a line ends when you press the
<b>EXECUTE</b> key. By using the &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; keys when
EXE is displayed on the screen, you can chose
whether this will generate carriage return and line
feed characters, or just carriage return. Carriage
return is shown on the screen as CR, and line feed is
shown as LF.
</p>

<p>
In the ASCII character set used by the Organiser,
carriage return is 13 (decimal) and line feed 10.
</p>

<p>
In general, if you are using the Organiser as a terminal
to a larger system you will only need carriage return to
end a line. If you are using the Organiser to transfer
tiles to another micro, or to send data to a printer, you
will probably need carriage return and line feed.
</p>

<h3>WIDTH</h3>

<p>
This feature is useful when you are sending data from
a datapak to a printer or for display on another
computer screen.
</p>

<p>
Records on the Organiser can be up to 200
characters long. Few printers or computer screens
can display lines this long. This feature allows you to
set the display width (or line length) to 40, 64, 80 or
132 characters
</p>

<p>
Suppose, for example, you are printing the contents of
a datapak and you set the width to 80 characters. If
the datapak contains a record which is over 80
characters long, the Organiser will tell the printer to
start a new line with the 81st character and, if
applicable, the 161st character.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively you can make sure that nothing is
displayed on the target screen, by setting width to
<b>OFF</b>.
</p>

<h3>HASH</h3>

<p>
One of the most common difficulties users find is in
displaying and printing the British pound sign. Every
time you want a pound sign to appear, a hash is
shown, and on the rare occasions you want a hash,
the pound will pop up.
</p>

<p>
This is because most computer systems use the same
ASCII code (35 decimal) to represent both. When the
Link-Up sends a £ to another computer, it sends
ASCII 35.
</p>

<p>
The HASH feature of SETUP allows you to choose
how ASCII 35 will be interpreted by the Organiser.
Suppose HASH is set to £. Then if the Organiser
receives ASCII 35, it will assume that it is supposed to
be a pound sign.
</p>

<p>
Internally, the Organiser uses ASCII 15 (or 0F in
hexadecimal) to represent the pound sign. If it
receives a pound sign, it converts it to ASCII 15 for
internal use. The ASCII character set used by the
Organiser is described in the chapter 6.
</p>

<h3>ECHO</h3>

<p>
If you are using the Organiser as a terminal to a larger
system you will probably want to set ECHO to HOST.
When you press a key on the keyboard, the Organiser
will not immediately display a character. The
character will be sent to the main system, and then the
system will echo the same character back. This is the
way most large computer systems work. If you ever
find that the Organiser is displaying double
characters, it will be because you have forgotten to set
the echo to HOST.
</p>

<p>
If you are using the Organiser for a local operation,
such as sending data to a printer or to a
microcomputer, set ECHO to LOCAL. The Organiser
will then display characters typed in at the keyboard
immediately.
</p>

<h3>PACK</h3>

<p>
When the Organiser receives data from another
computer, it can store this data on a datapak. It can
save the data either in 6-bit (packed) format or 8-bit
(unpacked) format.
</p>

<p>
When you are not using Link-Up, data stored with the
SAVE key is packed so that only six bits are used to
store every character. This packed storage allows the
Organiser to save up to eleven thousand characters
on an 8K datapak, and 22,000 characters on a 16K
datapak. Programs written in the Organiser
programming language POPL (as used by the Psion
Finance pack, Science pack and Maths pack) are
saved using 8-bit storage.
</p>

<p>
In 6 bit (packed) format, only characters with ASCII
values between 32 and 95 (decimal) can be saved.
Lower case letters cannot be stored. If you try to save
a record which includes lower case letters, they will be
converted to upper case letters before saving.
</p>

<p>
If you save in 8-bit format, you Will be able to save all
normal characters. However <b>you will not be able to
find data stored in 8-bit format unless you use the
Link-Up Software Pack 2</b>.
</p>

<h3>CTRL</h3>

<p>
When the Organiser is in terminal mode, the MODE
key becomes a CTRL key. By using this key, you can
generate all the characters on a normal typewriter
keyboard. For example, pressing MODE then zero (0
is shifted U) generates the exclamation mark.
</p>

<p>
In SETUP the CTRL option does not set any of the
transmission parameters. It serves to remind you of
the control sequences used to generate characters
which are available but not shown on the keyboard.
</p>

<h3>Leaving Set-Up</h3>

<p>
The final item to be displayed as you move down the
list of parameters is <b>EXIT</b>. You can select either of its
two options, <b>SAVE</b> and <b>NO SAVE</b>. with the &gt;&gt; and
&lt;&lt; keys.
</p>

<p>
If you are likely to use the settings frequently, use the
&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt; key to select the <b>SAVE</b> option before
pressing <b>EXECUTE</b>. Once the settings have been
saved they will appear as the default when the
communications software is next loaded.
</p>

<p>
If you have not changed the settings of any parameter,
or it the setup you have created will only be used
once, the <b>NO SAVE</b> option and press
<b>EXECUTE</b>.
</p>

<p>
In either case the parameter settings you have
selected will be retained in the memory of the
Organiser. The retained settings can be changed at
any time or entirely deleted by executing the <b>RESET</b>
command. The settings are not affected by turning off
the Organiser, removing the Link-Up Software Pack 1
or fitting a datapak. If you do not use the <b>RESET</b>
command the settings will only be deleted when you
fit another program pack or disconnect the battery.
</p>

<hr>

<a name="c4"></a><h2>4<br>Terminal Mode</h2>

<p>
When you have used SETUP, you can turn the
Organiser off and remove the Link-Up Software Pack.
You will not need it again, unless you wish to change
the transmission parameters. The communications
software remains loaded until you use the RESET
command or use another program pack, such as the
Psion Finance pack.
</p>

<p>
Turning off the Organiser allows you to fit the Link-Up
Cable, needed to make physical connection with the
target. When you have slotted the Link-Up Cable into
the back of the Organiser and fitted it and, if
necessary, the appropriate adaptor to the serial
communications socket of your target, you are ready
to enter terminal mode.
</p>

<h3>Selecting TERM</h3>

<p>
If you turn your Organiser on with the Link-Up Cable
in place, the Organiser will give you three options
when you press the <b>MODE</b> key. They are:
</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="code"><b>ENTER:</b></span><br>
<span class="code"><b>OFF:</b>     </span>and<br>
<span class="code"><b>TERM:</b></span>
</p>

<p>
If you do not have the Link-Up Cable in place, only
<b>ENTER</b> and <b>OFF</b> will be offered as options.
</p>

<p>
If you select TERM (by pressing EXECUTE when
TERM is displayed on the screen) you will enter
Terminal mode. Your Organiser is now a handheld
terminal, waiting to send or receive data from its
target. If ECHO is set to LOCAL characters entered
from the keyboard will immediately be shown on the
screen. If ECHO is set to HOST, characters will only be
shown on the screen when the host machine accepts
and echoes them.
</p>

<p>
<b>MODE</b> and <b>SPACE</b> are used to leave terminal mode.
</p>

<h3>Key Definitions</h3>

<p>
When you are in terminal mode, many of the keys on
the Organiser keyboard have special uses.
</p>

<p>
The <b>ON/CLEAR</b> key returns the cursor to the left of
the Organiser screen.
</p>

<p>
The <b>MODE</b> key is now used as a <b>CTRL</b> key. Pressing
MODE then another key will send the CTRL definition
of that key. For example, pressing MODE then M will
send a carriage return.
</p>

<p>
There is a standard control definition for each letter of
the alphabet. In addition, the control key and the
yellow and blue characters on the keyboard are used
to generate characters which do not appear on the
Organiser CTRL (MODE) then 5, for instance. gives [.
Figure 4.1 lists the control characters you can use.
</p>

<p>
The SHIFT key will, as usual, change between letters
and numbers. The cursor will be an underline when
letters are available or flashing when numbers are
available. All the yellow and blue characters may be
used with the Link-Up Software Pack 2.
</p>

<p>
Letters typed in on the Organiser may appear in
Upper or lower case. The CTRL key and the arrow
keys change between upper and lower case letters.
CTRL (MODE) then &lt;&lt; changes to lower case. Any
</p>

<div class="indent">
<table class="ctrl" summary="">

<p><small>Figure 4.1 CTRL sequences</small></p>
</div>

<p>
letters entered from the keyboard will appear in lower
case. (Data from the target machine will appear in
upper and lower case, depending on the way it is
received). Conversely, CTRL then &gt;&gt; changes to
upper case.
</p>

<p>
It you are using XON/XOFF handshaking, the &gt;&gt; key
is also used to toggle scrolling.
</p>

<p>
<b>To leave terminal mode</b> press CTRL then
SPACE.
</p>

<h3>SAVE and FIND</h3>

<p>
When you are in terminal mode the SAVE and FIND
keys are used to receive and send files.
</p>

<p>
FIND is used to send the contents of a datapak to the
target. If you have a datapak in your Organiser, press
ON/CLEAR then FIND, and all the records on the
datapak will be sent to the target. If you type in a
string, then press FIND. all the records containing that
string will be sent to the target.
</p>

<p>
SAVE is used to receive a file sent by the target and
save it on a datapak. Suppose you are using the
Organiser as a terminal to another computer. Most
operating systems have a command which displays
the contents of a file on the screen. If you have a
datapak in your Organiser, type in the command to
display a file, then press SAVE instead of EXECUTE.
The file will then be saved, line by line, on the datapak.
When the file has been saved on the datapak, press
ON/CLEAR to terminate the data.
</p>

<p>
Characters received by the Organiser will only be
displayed on the screen after a carriage return has
arrived. They are saved record by record, not
character by character Remember that there is a
maximum of 200 characters per record.
</p>

<p>
If you are using the Organiser to transfer files with
another micro, press SAVE, then use the appropriate
command to send a file from the other computer.
</p>

<p>
Remember that it you have selected 6-bit packed
storage, only a limited character set will be used to
save the file. Lower case letters will be converted to
upper case. If you have selected 8-bit storage, the full
ASCII character set may be saved to the datapak, but
records stored in this way cannot be accessed from
the normal Organiser operating system.
</p>

<hr>

<a name="c5"></a><h2>5<br>Examples</h2>

<p>
This chapter consists of examples which show how to
connect the Organiser to various target devices.
</p>

<h3>Telecom Gold</h3>

<p>
Telecom Gold is an electronic mailbox system,
operated by British Telecom. Subscribers may log on
to the system through the telephone system, and
send or read messages.
</p>

<p>
To access Telecom Gold, you need a modem, a
telephone and an account with Telecom Gold. If you
do not have an account with Telecom Gold, you can
still get as far as receiving the Telecom Gold welcome
message.
</p>

<p>
First SETUP the transmission parameters. Telecom
Gold can be accessed at 300 Baud for both transmit
and receive, so TBAUD and RBAUD must be set to
300. Other parameters must be set as follows:
</p>

<p class="indent code"><b>PAR    - EVEN
BITS   - 7
STOP   - 1
HAND   - XON/XOFF
EXE    - CR
HASH   - £
ECHO   - HOST</b></p>


<p>
Make sure that the Link-Up Cable you have is
correctly wired to communicate with your modem. In
order to connect to most modems, you will need an
RS232 cable which terminates with a DTE connector.
The standard Link-Up Cable is wired with a DCE
connector. Appendix A describes how to determine
whether your equipment needs a DTE or DCE
connector. A 25 pin D type connector to make this
conversion is available through your Organiser dealer
or direct from Psion Limited.
</p>

<p>
Replace Link-Up Software Pack 2 in your Organiser
with the Link-Up Cable and connect the Organiser
and modem. Put the Organiser into terminal mode.
</p>

<p>
Dial the telephone number for Telecom Gold. In
London the number is 01 583 3000. There are also
telephone numbers throughout the British Isles which
can be used to connect to the Telecom Gold system.
When your call is connected, you should hear a
whistling tone. When you hear this tone, connect the
telephone to the modem. You should see the
welcome message appearing on the screen of the
Organiser. If you have access to the system, you can
then log in, as normal.
</p>

<h3>Microcomputers</h3>

<p>
On most microcomputers you will need to run some
sort of program which performs a similar function to
the SETUP command. It will set the parameters such
as Baud rate, parity checking etc. This may be a
commercially marketed communications package or
a program you have written yourself. Alternatively the
commands to set the transmission parameters can
often be accessed from the operating system, and
can be executed one by one.
</p>

<h3>ACT Apricot</h3>

<p>
Much of the following description of communication
with the Apricot, also applies for communication with
Victor/Sirius computers
</p>

<h3>The hardware interface</h3>

<p>
The centre port of the ACT Apricot is an RS232
interface. A Link-Up Adaptor to connect the Link-Up
Cable to this port is available from your Organiser
dealer or direct from Psion Limited.
</p>

<h3>Matching the software parameters</h3>

<p>
The ACT Apricot is provided with a standard
communications package - "ASYNC". Run ASYNC
to set the software parameters on the Apricot. Use the
SETUP command to set the software parameters on
the Organiser.
</p>

<p>
To use Link-Up with the Apricot, you must choose the
user specified terminal option of ASYNC's main
menu. You can then set the Baud rate, the parity
convention, the number of data and stop bits and
whether you want XON/XOFF handshaking. Note that
if you want XON/XOFF handshaking on the Apricot.
you must set the receive and send parameters
separately. On the Link-Up software pack,
handshaking for both sending and receiving is set
with one command. XON/XOFF is the only form of
handshaking possible with ASYNC.
</p>

<p>
Set both the Link-Up pack and ASYNC to local echo.
Make sure that EXECUTE is defined as carriage
return and line feed on the Link-Up pack.
</p>

<h3>Sending and Receiving Data</h3>

<p>
Start terminal operation by selecting the relevant
option of ASYNC. Enter terminal mode on the
Organiser, and everything you type on the Organiser
will appear on the screen of both the Apricot and the
Organiser.
</p>

<p>
If you have a datapak in your Organiser, you will be
able to send and receive individual or groups of
records. In order to send files from the Apricot, set the
Organiser to receive (by pressing SAVE) then select
the send option from the microscreen menu. When
the file has been received, press the ON/CLEAR key
on the Organiser.
</p>

<h3>Printers</h3>

<p>
Link-Up always uses serial data transmission. Some
dot-matrix printers only have parallel ports as
standard. In contrast, daisywheel printers almost
always use serial transmission. On most printers.
transmission parameters are set by DIP switches.
which are small switches commonly found under the
front cover of the printer.
</p>

<h3>Epson FX 80</h3>

<p>
Hardware Interface An adaptor is needed to connect
the Link-Up Cable to the Epson FX 80 serial interface.
This may be available from your computer dealer or
ordered direct from Psion Limited. It is also possible to
wire an adaptor yourself. The Epson only needs three
connections to be made. These are:
</p>


<table class="indent" summary="">
<tbody><tr><td>Link-Up     </td><td>Epson</td></tr>
<tr><td>3           </td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>4           </td><td>11</td></tr>
<tr><td>7           </td><td>7</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Transmission parameters</h3>

<p>
The transmission parameters of the Epson are set by
dip switches on the serial interface card. As the
meanings and settings of these switches may vary
between different versions of the serial interface card,
you must consult the manual to your interface. It
should be possible to set the switches to match the
following SETUP:
</p>

<p class="indent code"><b>TBAUD     2400
RBAUD     2400
PARITY    NONE
BITS      8
STOP      1
HAND      RTS/CTS
EXE       CRLF</b></p>

<p>
The screen size should be set to the width of your
printer paper. If you want the data printed to be
displayed on the screen of the Organiser, you should
set ECHO to LOCAL. The HASH and PACK options
do not affect printing. When this SETUP has been
created you can send the contents of a datapak to the
printer using FIND.
</p>

<hr>

<a name="c6"></a><h2>6<br>Technical data</h2>

<h3>Organiser character set</h3>

<p>
The characters displayed by the Organiser
correspond to Hitachi standard HD44780A00.
Remember that, when the data IS saved in the packed
(6-bit) format, only characters 20 (hex) to 5F (hex)
inclusive can be saved on the datapak.
</p>

<p>
Characters with an ASCII value of over 127 cannot be
generated from the Organiser keyboard. However if
BITS is set to 8, and PACK is set to 8-bit, the Organiser
can receive, save and then transmit 8 bit data.
</p>

<p>
A carriage return cannot be saved on the datapak as
part of a normal record.
</p>

<p>
Internally, the Organiser uses ASCII 0F (hex) to
represent the pound sign. As described in chapter 3,
the Organiser transmits and receives the pound sign
as ASCII 23 (hex).

<p>
<small><b>The character set</b> - Figure 6.1
</small></p>

</div>

<h3>Handshaking</h3>

<p>
Link-Up recognises XON/XOFF and RTS/CTS
handshaking.
</p>

<p>
XON/XOFF handshaking - after Link-Up has
transmitted an XOFF character there will be a short
interval before the target machine receives this
character and stops transmitting data. Up to eight
characters can be received in the Organiser overflow
buffer during this time. Any further characters will be
lost.
</p>

<p>
Link-Up sends an additional XOFF for every character
received.
</p>

<p>
DSR/DTR handshaking is similar to RTS/CTS
handshaking. if you wish to communicate with a
device which uses DSR/DTR handshaking, set the
Link-Up pack to RTS/CTS handshaking, then
communicate through an adaptor which connects the
RTS and CTS lines from the Organiser to the DSR and
DTR lines of the target. Your Organiser dealer may be
able to supply you with a suitable adaptor.
Alternatively you can order one direct from Psion
Limited.
</p>

<h3>Power consumption</h3>

<p>
When the Organiser is in use with the Link-Up system
power consumption is high. If you have only the Link-
Up Cable in place, 54 milliamps of current are used. If
you have a datapak and the Link-Up Cable in place
78 milliamps are used.
</p>

<p>
When you save data to a datapak, the Organiser uses
additional power. Average battery life when the
Organiser is used with the Link-Up system is
approximately 10 hours.
</p>

<h3>Voltage levels</h3>

<p>
The RS232 standard specifies that voltages between
-3V and -25V are to be used to represent logic 1,
and voltages between +3V and +25V are to be used
for logic 0.
</p>

<p>
Link-Up uses voltages of -5V and +5V for
transmitting 1 and 0 respectively. It can receive
signals from the whole RS232 voltage range.
</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>
As with all computing equipment, there may well
come a time when you find that you are stuck and feel
that you can go no further. This section is designed to
help you solve some of the more common problems
users have experienced with the Link-Up packs.
</p>

<p>
<b>You cannot see how to connect the Organiser to
your target.</b>
</p>

<p>
To use the Link-Up Software Packs you need the
Psion Link-Up Cable, which is sold separately. It is an
RS232 cable which slots in to either of the positions
normally used by datapaks or program packs.
</p>

<p>
<b>You can not see how to join the Link-Up Cable to
your target.</b>
</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>If your target is a mainframe or minicomputer.
   you should find one of the ports normally used
   to connect terminals to the computer. Ask your
   systems supervisor where they are.
</li><li>If you want to login to a system via a modem,
   you must connect the Link-Up Cable to the
   modem. There should be a port on the modem
   to which you can connect the Link-Up Cable.
</li><li>If your target is a microcomputer, it may have an
   RS232 port, usually on the back of the machine
   where it is most difficult to get at. Some of the
   cheaper home micros do not have an RS232
   port. They cannot be connected to the
   organiser. Other micros have two RS232 ports,
   They may be labelled serial ports or RS232
   ports.
</li><li>If your target is a printer, make sure that it does
   have an RS232 (or serial) port. Some printers
   only have a parallel port, the most popular
   being the Centronics parallel interface. It is
   possible to connect a serial interface to a
   parallel port, but only with additional hardware.
</li></ol>

<p>
<b>You cannot get the word "SETUP" to appear on the
screen.</b>
</p>

<p>
You can only get to the SETUP command when the
Organiser has been powered up with a Link-Up
Software pack in place. Try turning the Organiser off.
inserting the your Link-Up Software pack, then
turning it on again.
</p>

<p>
<b>You cannot get into terminal mode.
</b></p>

<p>
You can only get into terminal mode after SETUP has
been used, and when the Link-Up Cable is in place. If
only ENTER: and OFF: appear on the screen of the
Organiser, then the Link-Up Cable is not in place. Turn
the Organiser off, insert the Link-Up Cable and turn
on again. If CALC is also available, this means you still
have to use the SETUP command. Turn off the
Organiser, insert your Link-Up Software Pack and go
through the actions described in chapter three.
</p>

<p>
<b>Nothing happens when you go into terminal mode
</b></p>

<p>
Press the EXECUTE key a few times. If nothing
happens, check the wiring used between the
Organiser and target. Check whether your target
RS232 port is wired as DTE or DCE. If you are using
hardware handshaking (RTS/CTS or DSR/DTR) check
the wiring on the connector between the Link-Up
Cable and your target.
</p>

<p>
<b>Characters you type in on the Organiser appear
twice on the screen
</b></p>

<p>
This usually means that the ECHO option has been
set to LOCAL, when it should be set to HOST. If the
ECHO is set to HOST when it should be set to LOCAL
nothing at all will appear on the screen of the
Organiser when keys are pressed.
</p>

<p>
<b>You cannot leave terminal mode
</b></p>

<p>
Press MODE, take your finger off it, then press
SPACE.
</p>

<p>
<b>If all else fails, remove the battery, wait a couple of
minutes, press the ON/CLEAR</b> key once or twice,
then reconnect the battery.

<a name="cA"></a><h2>Appendix A<br>The Link-Up Cable</h2>

<p>
The hardware interface needed for Organiser
communications is sold separately from the Link-Up
Software packs. The hardware, the Psion Link-Up
Cable can be fitted to either solid state drive of your
Organiser. The socket at the other end of the Link-Up
Cable is designed to connect to equipment using the
RS232C and RS423 communications standards. This
appendix shows you how to make sure that the wiring
of your target device is compatible with the Link-Up
Cable.
</p>

<h3>Standards in the microcomputer industry</h3>

<p>
Part of the fascination of the microcomputer industry
is that it was started and has been fuelled mainly by
the invention and industry of talented individuals. The
disadvantage of this is that talented individuals can
rarely agree on a standard. So it is with the RS232
interface. There are differences even between
connectors which are described as standard. This
appendix describes the wiring of the connector
supplied with the Link-Up Cable, using as little jargon
as possible. Read through this appendix carefully
and compare the wiring of the Link-Up Cable with that
of your target device.
</p>

<h3>Plugs and sockets</h3>

<p>
The Link-Up Cable is terminated with a 25 way D type
socket (It has been wired so that it will connect
directly into an IBM PC.) The socket has receptacle
contacts and must be connected to a plug, with pin
contacts. Figure 1 illustrates both connectors.

<p>
To connect up the Organiser to the target equipment
you must check that the pinout of the target RS232
connector matches that of the Link-Up Cable socket
pinout. If the wiring is compatible then there is no
problem - connect the Link-Up Cable directly to
your target. If the wiring is different or the target
connector does not fit the Link-Up Cable connector,
you will either have to buy or wire an adaptor or
interconnection cable to go between the Link-Up
socket and your equipment. Your dealer may be able
to supply a suitable adaptor. Alternatively a range of
adaptors are available direct from Psion Limited.
</p>

<h3>The pin settings</h3>

<p>
Although there are 25 contacts on the D type socket,
only five are needed for data communication. Two are
used for data, two for control signals and one is signal
ground.
</p>

<p>
Data travels from the target to the Organiser on the
TxD line, and from the Organiser to the target on the
RxD line.
</p>

<p>
The direction in which your target expects data to
travel depends upon whether it is wired as Data
Communication Equipment (DCE) or Data Terminal
Equipment. A signal which is output for a DCE will be
input for a DTE. The difference between DCE and
DTE is explained later.
</p>

<h3>TxD and RXD</h3>

<p>
TxD is for serial data transmitted to the Organiser from
the target. RxD is data received from the Organiser.
These will normally be used, though for some
printers, RXD only need be connected.
</p>

<h3>RTS and CTS</h3>

<p>
The signals on these lines control when data is sent
on the TxD and RxD lines. This control is known as
handshaking, and is described in chapters 3 and 6.
Link-Up only uses them if the <b>RTS/CTS</b> protocol is
selected.
</p>

<p>
The signal from the Organiser to the target is on the
CTS (clear to send) line of the Link-Up Cable. The
signal from the target to the Organiser is on the RTS
(ready to send) line of the Link-Up Cable.
</p>

<p>
If your target is wired as Data Terminal Equipment the
connections run as you might expect. CTS on the
Link-Up Cable socket is connected to CTS on the
target connector, and similarly for RTS. If, however,
your target is wired as Data Communication
Equipment, CTS of the Link-Up Cable must be
connected to the RTS pin of the target, and vice versa.
</p>

<h3>DSR/DTR</h3>

<p>
These signals are not used by the Organiser, but the
relevant pins are connected together on the Link-Up
socket, so that equipment which requires a data set
ready signal will get one whenever it generates a data
terminal ready signal.
</p>

<h3>DTE and DCE wiring</h3>

<p>
The Link-Up Cable is wired as Data Communications
Equipment. This means that the RXD and CTS
connectors are output for the Organiser. The
convention is designed so that DCE connectors join
directly to DTE connectors. If your target is wired as
Data Terminal Equipment, RxD and CTS will be inputs
for your target. If your target is wired as Data
Communication Equipment, the RXD and CTS of the
Organiser must be connected to the TxD and RTS of
the target. The diagrams below show the direction of
data flow and the connections to be made between
the Organiser and DTE or DCE ports.
</p>

<p>
In general, if you are communicating with a micro or a
printer, the connector on the RS232 cable from the
Organiser should be wired as DCE. If you are using
the Organiser as a terminal to a mainframe or remote
system, the RS232 cable from the Organiser should
terminate in a DTE connector.
